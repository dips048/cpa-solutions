          <strong>We Specialize in Business Tax Preparation</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
          As a business owner, you're busy developing new products or services
          and making sure your business runs smoothly. You probably don't have
          time to reconcile your bank account or generate balance sheets to
          manage your cash flow, let alone read up on the latest tax laws to
          find out which tax breaks you can take advantage of.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you first started out, and money was tight, the do-it-yourself
          method of accounting might have worked just fine. But now that you
          have employees, pay estimated taxes, and need to manage your cash flow
          better, it's time to find a trusted advisor to partner with all year
          long--not just at tax time.
        </p>
        <h3>
          There's no better time than now to discuss tax planning strategies
          that will help you build a foundation for future success.
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Here is what we do for you:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>State and federal income tax preparation and filing</li>
          <li>Local and state sales tax compliance</li>
          <li>State and federal payroll tax</li>
          <li>
            Minimize tax liability through the use of proven tax planning
            strategies
          </li>
          <li>Profit and loss statements</li>
          <li>Mergers and Acquisitions</li>
          <li>Entity selection and structure (S-Corp, C-Corp, LLC)</li>

        <h3>Make Sure You Never Miss a Deadline Again</h3>
        <p>
          The IRS, as well as state and local governments, imposes strict
          deadlines for business tax obligations. Missing these tax deadlines
          and failing to comply with payroll and sales taxes negatively impacts
          your bottom line and may result in fines for non-compliance.
        </p>
        <p>
          As your trusted advisor, we make sure you stay on top of your tax
          obligations and avoid penalties and fees that reduce your
          profitability.
        </p>
