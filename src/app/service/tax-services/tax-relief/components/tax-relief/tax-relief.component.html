          <strong>If You Owe the IRS Money, We Can Help!</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Have you ever received a letter or notice from the IRS, ignored it,
          and now you owe penalties and fines on top of the taxes you already
          owe? &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>You're not alone.</p>
        <p>
          Millions of taxpayers receive letters or notices from the IRS every
          year. Most of the time there's nothing to worry about. But sometimes
          there is. Maybe you owe the IRS back taxes or failed to file a tax
          return because you owed the IRS money that you knew you didn't have.
          Maybe you were recently divorced, and your tax situation seemed too
          complicated to figure out. Or, perhaps you were just too busy to
          bother filing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whatever the reason, if the IRS has caught up to you and is demanding
          payment, the next step is likely to be garnishing your wages, putting
          a lien on your home or a levy on your bank account. The worst thing
          you can do is keep ignoring the situation because it won't be going
          away -- ever -- unless you take action.

          If you do not file, you can be prosecuted and punished with potential

          losing your freedom for failing to file your tax returns?

          <br />
          The IRS views failing to pay payroll taxes as the cardinal sin of tax
          delinquency because a large portion of the payroll taxes you pay as an
          employer is your employees' tax withholdings.

          <br />
          Liens filed against you by the IRS also show up on your credit report
          and often prevent you from opening a checking account or borrowing
          against any assets, like your home.

          The payment plan negotiated by us is always more favorable than any

          <br />
          An IRS seizure should not be taken lightly. The IRS will ultimately
          pursue seizure of your physical assets; your home, cars, boats,
          jewelry, motorcycles, insurance policies, and even your retirement
          funds.

          Your back taxes, interest, and penalties can be wiped out by filing
          bankruptcy. If you qualify, bankruptcy can be the best solution to
          resolve your crushing tax problems.

          Innocent Spouse Relief was designed to alleviate unjust situations
          where one spouse was clearly the victim of fraud perpetrated by their
          spouse or ex-spouse.

          Most people would be surprised to learn how much the IRS knows about
          them. Obtaining a copy of your IRS file is critical in analyzing the
          options available to resolve your tax problems.
