          <strong>Business Planning Is the Foundation of Future Success</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
          In today's fast-paced, competitive world, many businesses face
          unprecedented challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe yours does too. If you agree, then chances are you're spending
          more and more time on human resource issues, payroll tax compliance,
          and sales and use tax than you are on revenue-generating opportunities
          and planning for future growth.
