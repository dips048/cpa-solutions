          Cash flow refers to the movement of money flowing into and out of a
          business. Positive cash flow is when you bring in more money than you
          spend. It is what every business owner strives for because it enables
          you to pay your liabilities and invest in your business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conversely, if you are spending more money than you are bringing in,
          it is called negative cash flow. While there will be times when every
          business experiences temporary periods of negative cash flow, too many
          months of negative cash flow can - and will - cause a business to
          fail.&nbsp;
