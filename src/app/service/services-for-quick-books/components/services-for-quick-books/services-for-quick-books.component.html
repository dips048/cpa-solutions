        <h3>More Freedom to Focus on Your Business</h3>
        <p>
          When you use accounting software like QuickBooks, you'll have more
          time to focus on what you do best, which is run your business. Instead
          of searching through your filing cabinet or that stack of manila file
          folders piled high in the corner of your desk, you can quickly find
          the information you need using the search function and entering
          keywords. You can even search from your mobile, laptop, or your tax
          preparer's office if you're using cloud-based accounting software.
