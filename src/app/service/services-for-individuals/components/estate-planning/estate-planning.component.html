        <p>
          Planning for your family's financial future is not just for the one
          percent; it's important for everyone especially if you have a spouse
          or children.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The reality, of course, is that most people do procrastinate and never
          get around to estate planning until it is too late. There are many
          reasons why this happens. Perhaps you are under the impression that it
          is too expensive. Maybe you just don't want to think about death
          because it's unpleasant or feel that because you are young and
          healthy, there's plenty of time to worry about the future later.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, you could be wrong, and your family could be in for a
          surprise. Because if there's no estate plan in place, then state laws
          dictate how your assets and property are divvied up -- not you or your
          family.
