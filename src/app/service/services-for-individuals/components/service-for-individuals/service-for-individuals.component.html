          <strong>A Tax Headache Is Only One Mistake Away</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Every year, Congress promises to simplify the tax code, but every
          year, the tax code seems to become more complicated than ever. If
          you've tried tax preparation software and found it confusing, you're
          not alone. As the tax code becomes more complex, so does tax
          preparation software -- and you might not be getting all of the tax
          breaks you're entitled to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's something else you might not know: When you use tax software,
          you might not understand what's on those forms you sent to the IRS. If
          the IRS audits your return, do you know that your tax preparation
          software is not liable -- you are. Why take a chance?
        </p>
