  <p>
    This Financial Guide gives you a roadmap to the process of finding a good
    lawyer and making sure that the legal services you are getting are
    cost-effective. Before hiring an attorney, take the following steps.
  </p>

  <h3 class="cellcolor">
    <a name="1"></a>Step 1: Decide Whether You Need A Lawyer
  </h3>

  <p>
    You hire a lawyer to help you resolve disputes, engage in legal
    transactions, or assert your legal rights. For certain legally complex or
    time-consuming disputes or problems, there is no doubt that a lawyer is
    necessary. For example, if you want a will prepared, or a more complex
    business deal handled, you will need a lawyer. If a court case is involved
    (other than a simple, routine matter), you'll almost always need a lawyer.
    There may, however, be ways to resolve a problem or dispute without the
    specialized assistance of a lawyer.
  </p>

  <p>In deciding whether to hire a lawyer, consider the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Does the matter involve a complex legal issue, or is it likely to go to
      court? These two factors indicate you need a lawyer.
    </li>
    <li>
      Is a form or self-help book available that you can use instead of hiring a
      lawyer? You may be able to solve certain problems with no legal help or
      with only minimal assistance.
    </li>
    <li>
      Is a large amount of money, property, or time involved? These factors
      indicate that you probably you need a lawyer.
    </li>
    <li>
      Are there any non-lawyer legal resources available to assist you such as
      mediation, arbitration, or small claims court?
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Mediation or Arbitration</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    Dispute resolution centers, located in just about every state throughout the
    US are used to resolve problems in the areas of consumer complaints,
    landlord/tenant disputes, and disagreements between neighbors or family
    members. The names, services, and fees (if any) of the centers vary from
    place to place, but they generally use two methods to resolve problems:
    mediation and arbitration. Mediation involves a neutral person who assists
    the two sides to discuss their differences and possibly reach an agreement.
    In arbitration, the neutral third party conducts a more formal process and
    makes a decision (usually written) after listening to both sides.
  </p>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    If both parties can agree to it, using a dispute resolution center or a
    private mediation center can be a low-cost alternative to bringing a suit in
    court or hiring an attorney to represent you in a negotiation. In some
    areas, the court itself may refer certain types of cases to a mediation
    program.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Small Claims Court</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    Small claims court may be appropriate if you have a monetary claim for
    damages within the limits set by your state (usually $1,000 to $5,000).
    These courts are more informal and involve less paperwork than regular
    courts. The filing costs are low and the system is faster than the regular
    court system. If you file in small claims court, be prepared to act as your
    own attorney, gather the needed evidence, research the law, and present your
    story in court.
  </p>

  <p>
    Are you willing to collect information and do research on your own? Is there
    a time limit on when you must file suit? Ask the small claims court clerk or
    look it up in your local law library. You must file your case before this
    time limit (usually within a year). Are you able to prove that the person
    against whom you are making the claim owes you money? You must be able to
    prove legal liability and that you have suffered a financial loss as the
    result of someone else's action.
  </p>

  <p>
    In deciding whether to use small claims court, check the many "how-to" books
    in the library for general information. Check with the clerk of small claims
    court, local consumer agency, or legal aid office for more information in
    your area.
  </p>

  <!-- <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p> -->

  <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="2"></a>Step 2: Get Some Names</h3>

  <p>
    Once you have decided you need a lawyer, it's time to begin shopping around.
    The first step is to compile a list of names. The recommendation of someone
    whose judgment you trust is an excellent place to start your search. You may
    want to begin by asking relatives, friends, clergy, social workers, or your
    doctor for recommendations. Often those persons can refer you to someone who
    has provided similar legal services for them. You need to know more about
    the lawyer than simply that he or she is a good attorney. Ask those making
    the recommendation for specific information about the type of legal help the
    lawyer provided them and how their case was handled.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Bar Association Referral Lists</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    Many state and local bar associations maintain lawyer referral lists by
    specialty. A referral service will provide you with the name of an attorney
    who specializes in the area you need. Keep in mind, however, that a referral
    is not a recommendation and does not guarantee a level of experience. Bar
    associations may charge participating lawyers and law firms a fee to be
    included on the referral list.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="caution">
    <p>
      <strong>Caution:</strong> Many bar associations have committees that
      conduct training or public service work in specialized areas. An attorney
      serving on one of these committees could have the expertise you are
      looking for.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      <strong>Tip:</strong> If you use a referral service, ask how attorneys are
      chosen to be listed with that particular service. Many services make
      referrals to all lawyers who are members (regardless of type and level of
      experience) of a particular organization.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Other Resources</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    Two of the larger lawyer directories are probably available at your local
    library. <a href="https://www.martindale.com">Martindale-Hubbell</a> online
    lists profiles for over one million lawyers and firms in the United States,
    Canada, and 160 other countries, alphabetically by state and by categories.
    Each entry has a biography, with information on each lawyer's education,
    specialty, law firm, and the date of admittance to the bar. It also includes
    a "rating" based on information supplied by fellow lawyers. The Who's Who in
    American Law directory lists about 24,000 lawyers and includes biographical
    notes. However, this directory is somewhat difficult to use because the
    lawyers are listed alphabetically rather than by state or specific area of
    expertise.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many communities also have other lawyer referral services to assist people
    in finding a lawyer. Often the services are for specific groups such as
    persons with disabilities, older persons, or victims of domestic violence.
    Groups that may be good sources for a local referral include the Alzheimer's
    Association and other support groups for specific diseases, such as Children
    of Aging Parents, the Older Women's League, the state civil liberties union,
    a local social services agency, or the local agency on aging.
  </p>

  <p>
    Other referral services may be financed by a few lawyers who receive all the
    referrals. Some services may screen the lawyers who wish to have referrals
    in a particular area.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lawyers are permitted to advertise within specific guidelines. You will be
    able to gather some useful information from ads. However, as with any
    advertisement, take everything with a grain of salt.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many attorneys specializing in areas of the law in which there may be
    substantial fees--such as personal injury or medical malpractice--advertise
    free consultations. Advertisements may list a set fee for a particular type
    of case. Many attorneys who do not advertise may also provide free
    consultations or offer set fees for a certain legal problem.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="caution">
    <p>
      <strong>Caution:</strong> Keep in mind that set fees are usually for
      routine, uncomplicated cases. Your case may not be regarded as simple.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    In addition, the court and your banker may be good referral sources.
    Finally, the yellow pages of the telephone book often list lawyers according
    to their specialties.
  </p>

  <!-- <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p> -->

  <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="3"></a>Step 3: Start Asking Questions</h3>

  <p>
    To start the process of hiring a lawyer, call several lawyers to whom you
    have been referred or about whom you have heard. Ask them the preliminary
    questions listed below before committing yourself to a consultation. The
    answers you get will help you choose the two or three lawyers you wish to
    interview.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since this is only a preliminary telephone conversation, ask questions that
    can be answered briefly. Here are some questions to ask:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Will you provide a free consultation for the initial interview?</li>
    <li>How long have you been in practice?</li>
    <li>
      What percentage of your cases are similar to my type of legal problem? (A
      lawyer with experience in handling cases like yours will be more
      efficient, which may save you money.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Can you provide me with any references, such as trust officers in banks,
      other attorneys, or clients?
    </li>
    <li>
      Do you represent any clients or special-interest groups that might cause a
      conflict of interest?
    </li>
    <li>
      What type of fee arrangement do you require? Are the fees negotiable?
    </li>
    <li>
      What type of information should I bring with me to the initial
      consultation?
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Follow up your phone calls by scheduling interviews with at least two of the
    attorneys. Don't feel embarrassed about selecting only the best candidates
    or canceling appointments with some of the attorneys after you complete all
    of your exploratory calls.
  </p>

  <!-- <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p> -->

  <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="4"></a>Step 4: Interview The Candidates</h3>

  <p>
    A personal interview is absolutely necessary. Whether you want a lawyer for
    a single transaction or over a period of years, you will be sharing details
    of your life and relying upon this person's expertise and advice. Since the
    lawyer will act on your behalf, it is critical that you feel comfortable
    with your attorney and that your will function in an atmosphere of mutual
    respect. A personal interview is the best way to make this judgment.
  </p>

  <p>
    Come prepared with a brief summary of your immediate case (including dates
    and facts) as well as a list of general questions for the attorney.
  </p>

  <p>
    The purpose of the interview is twofold: (1) to decide if the attorney has
    the necessary experience and is available to take your case; and, (2) to
    decide if you are comfortable with the fee arrangement and, most
    importantly, comfortable working with the attorney.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since this an initial consultation, it may not be a lengthy one. Be concise
    and approach the interview in a businesslike manner. Be prepared to take
    notes, to listen carefully to the attorney, and to make observations about
    the office and how it is run.
  </p>

  <p>Bring to the interview:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A brief, written summary of your case</li>
    <li>A list of questions for the attorney</li>
    <li>Cards or a small notebook</li>
    <li>A pen/pencil for notes</li>
    <li>Copies of any notices you have received</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In addition to any unanswered questions from the telephone calls, you may
    want to consider asking the following questions:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>How long has this attorney worked on cases like yours?</li>
    <li>
      Based on your brief description of the problem, ask about the range of
      outcomes you could expect (rough estimate of the length of time, cost for
      legal services, and size of the award if any). Ask if the case is likely
      to be settled or will it go to trial.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote class="caution">
    <p>
      <strong>Caution:</strong> Many factors affect how a case is decided. If
      the attorney gives you an ironclad promise that you will win, a red flag
      should go up.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Ask for an opinion of the strengths and weaknesses of a case like yours.
        This should be based on your lawyer's experience with similar cases.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Ask who will be working on your case. Will this attorney be doing all of
        the research, case preparation, negotiation, and court work, or will
        associates or non-attorney advocates be handling parts of it? What are
        the experience and expertise of these other advocates? Will other
        experts, including other attorneys, be consulted? If so, who will they
        be? If others will work on the case, what will the fee arrangement be?
        (These questions are particularly important to ask of attorneys
        practicing in large law firms where work is often delegated to
        associates and/or paralegals.)
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Ask about fees and expenses. These are not the same. An attorney's fee
        is the payment you make for the attorney's time. Expenses refer to a
        variety of other costs including witness fees, court filing fees,
        copying, messenger service, etc. (See the question on fees below.)
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Ask if the attorney will work out a written fee agreement with you. (The
        specifics of the arrangement should be in writing.)
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Ask how often the attorney will bill you; is a retainer required?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Decide what type of involvement in the case you want. Ask if the
        attorney is comfortable with that level of involvement. (See the
        questions below on client involvement and cutting costs.)
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Find out what hours the attorney will be available for meetings. This
        may be particularly important if you must leave work to meet with the
        attorney. Will you meet in the evening or on weekends? Will the attorney
        visit your home, if needed?
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Observe how the attorney responds to your questions. Does he or she seem
    organized (take notes, etc.)? Respond openly and directly to your questions?
    Provide you with written background material on the topics of interest to
    you? Provide clear explanations?
  </p>

  <p>
    Observe the physical surroundings and office staff. Is the staff friendly?
    Are they responsive? Do people identify themselves on the telephone so you
    know to whom you are speaking? Does anyone explain the roles of people with
    whom you may be dealing? Is the pace frenetic, lackadaisical, or busy in an
    organized fashion?
  </p>

  <p>
    Observe your attorney during the preliminary interview to see whether he or
    she fits the bill:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><em>Neatness counts.</em> Does the attorney appear neat and clean?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Timeliness.</em> You should not be kept waiting for your
        appointment.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Focus.</em> Does the attorney leave the room frequently during your
        appointment? Does he or she take phone calls? You should be getting his
        complete attention. Does the attorney listen attentively, or does he or
        she appear bored or distracted, or glance at his or her watch?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Openness about fees.</em> An attorney who does not discuss fee
        arrangements up front may be more likely to surprise you with large,
        unexpected bills. The fee should be discussed at the first interview.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p> -->

  <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="5"></a>Step 5: Make Your Decision</h3>

  <p>
    After the interviews, review your notes. Look at the strengths and
    weaknesses of each attorney you interviewed. Decide what is most important
    to you. Factors to consider in choosing an attorney include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Cost.</em> Cost is rarely the only deciding factor unless it is a
        simple case which will take little time and that is the only contact you
        plan to have with the attorney. However, it is critical that you feel
        comfortable and knowledgeable about the financial arrangement. Disputes
        over fees are one of the most common conflicts between clients and
        attorneys.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Experience.</em> Does the attorney have the necessary experience for
        the case you have? For a simple will, a relatively new attorney may be a
        cost-effective choice. However, for a complex estate plan, you need
        someone with more experience. The higher fee is likely to be balanced by
        not having to pay for the attorney to learn on the job.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Availability.</em> Can the attorney accept the case immediately?
        Will the attorney be able to devote the time you want to the case? This
        is particularly important if you prefer a lot of interaction with your
        attorney.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Your Comfort Level/Mutual Respect.</em> It is important not to
        choose an attorney simply because you are impressed by the firm's
        reputation. You should be satisfied with the expertise of the people
        actually working on your case. Will you trust them enough to tell them
        private matters relevant to the case that you may not have shared with
        others? Do you believe the attorney treats your ideas and opinions with
        respect?
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p> -->

  <h3 class="cellcolor">
    <a name="6"></a>Step 6: Clarify Fee Arrangements and Similar Issues
  </h3>

  <p>
    Fees are one of the least discussed parts of any legal case, yet are highly
    important to both client and lawyer. Frequently fees are not discussed early
    enough, candidly enough, or in enough detail. Why? Generally, the discussion
    can be uncomfortable for both parties. However, becoming knowledgeable about
    the types of fee arrangements can increase your comfort level in dealing
    with this crucial part of hiring an attorney.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      <strong>Tip:</strong> Remember: The specifics of a fee arrangement should
      be in writing.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The market rate for any given legal service varies by locality. A "fair" fee
    is what seems fair to you, based on your knowledge of going rates. Whether
    you are comfortable with a fee is likely to be based on the following
    factors:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>How much you can afford</li>
    <li>Whether the case is routine or requires special expertise</li>
    <li>The range of attorney rates for this type of case in your area</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The fee arrangement you make with your lawyer will significant affect how
    much you will pay for the services.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Types Of Fee Arrangements</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>Here are several common types of fee arrangements used by lawyers:</p>

  <p>
    <em>Flat fee.</em> The lawyer will charge you a specific total fee for your
    case. A flat fee is usually offered only if your case is relatively simple
    or routine.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      <strong>Tip:</strong> Ask if photocopying, typing, and other out-of-pocket
      expenses are covered by this flat fee. Often the total bill is the flat
      fee plus these out-of-pocket expenses.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    <em>Hourly rate.</em> The attorney will charge you for each hour (or a
    portion of an hour) that he or she works on your case. If your attorney's
    fee is $100 per hour, and he or she works ten hours, the cost will be
    $1,000. Some attorneys charge a higher rate for court work and less per hour
    for research or case preparation.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      <strong>Tip:</strong> If you agree to an hourly rate, be sure to find out
      how much experience your attorney has had with your type of case. A less
      experienced attorney will usually require more time to research your case,
      although he or she may charge a lower hourly rate.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Large law firms usually charge more than small law firms and urban attorneys
    often charge more per hour than attorneys practicing in rural areas.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      <strong>Tip:</strong> Ask what is included in the hourly rate. If other
      staff such as secretaries, messengers, paralegals, and law clerks will be
      working on your case, find out how their time will be charged to you. Ask
      about costs and out-of-pocket expenses, which are usually billed in
      addition to the hourly rate.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    <em>Contingency fee.</em> Under this arrangement, the attorney's fee is
    based on a percentage of what you are awarded in the case. If you lose the
    case, the attorney does not get a fee, although you will still have to pay
    expenses. The contingency fee percentage varies and some lawyers offer a
    sliding scale based on how far along the case is when it is settled. A
    one-third fee is common.
  </p>

  <p>
    A contingency fee is usually found in personal injury cases, accidental
    claims, property damage cases, or other cases where a large amount of money
    is involved.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Referral fee.</em> On occasion, an attorney who has accepted your case
    may refer you to another attorney who specializes in the area you need.
    Sometimes the first attorney will ask for a portion of the total fee you pay
    for the case. This "referral fee" may be prohibited under state codes of
    professional responsibility unless certain rules are followed. The rules
    usually include a requirement that client fees be split only if each
    attorney does some work, the client knows about the arrangement, and the
    total fee is reasonable.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Suggestions for Ensuring Cost Effectiveness</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    It is important to remember that a lawyer's fees are often negotiable. Your
    lawyer is unlikely to invite you to bargain over fees, and you may not want
    to bring the subject up. Keep in mind, however, that there are some
    situations in which attorneys are more likely to consider a lower fee. If
    your case is interesting, unique, or extremely lucrative, an attorney may be
    willing to negotiate. If the firm is actively seeking more work or is new to
    your locality, it may handle a case for less as a way to build its caseload.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are two general situations in which you may wish to raise the issue of
    lower fees. First, if your case has the possibility of significant
    attorney's fees, you are in a stronger position if you are willing to shop
    around and to negotiate. It's wise to negotiate, for example, in personal
    injury cases. Most lawyers will propose a standard contingency fee for
    one-third of any damages that they win for you, nothing if they lose.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      <strong>Tip:</strong> The contingency fee is designed to cover the risk
      the lawyer is taking; yet some experts estimate that at least one out of
      every five contingency fee cases involves virtually no risk.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    It makes sense to sit down with several different lawyers before choosing
    one. Ask each to assess the merits of the case and the likelihood that you
    will receive money if you are successful. The consultations will be free and
    you will come away with a more realistic sense of what fee arrangements you
    should agree to. Generally, the higher the likelihood of success in a case,
    the lower the contingency percentage you may be able to negotiate. Some
    clients also prefer to pay their lawyers on a sliding scale, for example, 33
    percent for the first $100,000 in damages, 25 percent for the next $100,000,
    and 15 percent above that.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may be able to negotiate other arrangements that will save you money,
    including flat fees instead of hourly charges, hourly rates up to a
    prearranged maximum for the entire project, and fees based partly on the
    outcome.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Comparison Shop for Flat Fees on Simple Cases</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    When you need a simple transaction like a will, a real estate closing, or a
    power of attorney, you can comparison shop. Contracting for legal services
    is like any other consumer transaction in that the prices and the work
    product vary. Call several attorneys and compare their answers to the
    questions listed above. Only after you get a sense of the range of fees will
    you be able to determine which rate and which attorney best suit you and
    your budget.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Ask About Billing Method for Hourly Rates</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    A written agreement specifying the fee arrangement and the work involved is
    the best way of assuring clear communication between you and your attorney
    about the total cost of the case.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      <strong>Tip:</strong> In some cases, it may save hundreds of dollars if
      you ask a lawyer to bill at 6-minute instead of 15-minute intervals. For
      example, if a lawyer's minimum billing unit is 15 minutes, each 5-minute
      phone call will be billed at one-fourth of the hourly rate. At 6-minute
      phone intervals, a 5-minute phone call costs just one-tenth of the hourly
      rate.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Choose a Lawyer with the Appropriate Qualifications</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    Most legal work is relatively routine. It often has little to do with
    complex legal theory or analysis, and much more to do with knowing which
    form to fill out and which county clerk will process it most quickly.
    Smaller firms, attorneys charging lower rates, and less experienced
    attorneys are often well suited for the broad range of legal work needed by
    many consumers. Recently graduated attorneys may offer to work for a
    somewhat lower price to compensate for the extra risk and time involved in
    becoming familiar with the specific area of law. Lawyers who charge $300 an
    hour and up are appropriate for very sophisticated trusts and estate work,
    corporate litigation, or complex criminal defense work.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      <strong>Tip:</strong> Be wary of big law firms where you may get the
      impression that the young associate who has been assigned to your case (at
      a lower rate) is being supervised closely by the senior partners listed in
      the firm name. The associate may take three or four times as long as an
      experienced lawyer to draft the necessary papers. You might want to meet
      with the associate and the supervising partner before work begins to
      ascertain who is going to do what and to get an estimate as to how much
      the work should cost. Such a meeting may prevent the firm from charging
      you for an associate's on-the-job training.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Offer to Perform Some of the Work</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    Discuss ways that you can help the attorney on the case. For example, if the
    attorney needs copies of birth certificates or other records, you can write
    the letter to request them and save your attorney the time needed to dictate
    and process the letter.
  </p>

  <p>
    Splitting the work with an attorney also can cut the cost of writing a will
    or health-care power of attorney or setting up a trust. You can draft the
    document, using a standard form as a guide, and then present it to your
    lawyer for reviewing and finalizing the work. Make sure that your attorney
    is willing to do this kind of work and discuss the fee if major rewriting is
    needed.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Hire the Attorney to Act as Go-Between</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    Some lawyers are open to negotiating a lower fee if you are only looking for
    their legal expertise to write a letter to the other side to settle. You may
    wish to hire the attorney for this type of limited assistance initially and
    follow up yourself. If you are unsuccessful, you may wish to retain the
    attorney to further pursue the case.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Hire the Attorney to Act as Your Pro Se Coach</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    If you want to represent yourself in court (called "appearing pro se"), hire
    your attorney to act as a pro se coach who will review documents and letters
    that you prepare and sign. The attorney may also help you prepare for a
    hearing in which you represent yourself. This might be appropriate when
    appearing in small claims court to enforce a lease or collect bills owed to
    you, for example.
  </p>

  <p>
    Not all attorneys will be comfortable in this role, but some, especially in
    smaller firms, may be interested in empowering consumers.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Choose a Lawyer Who Specializes in What You Need</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    You are likely to save money by choosing someone who has the knowledge and
    office systems set up to handle cases like yours cost-effectively. That
    attorney is also more likely to be knowledgeable about specific procedures
    relating to your case, expert witnesses in the area, and other attorney
    experts for consultation.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="note">
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> A rapidly growing specialty in the legal profession
      is "Elder Law," which includes traditional areas of legal practice such as
      estate planning and probate, as well as public benefits such as Medicare
      and Social Security, and issues such as planning for long-term care
      placement and health-care decision-making. Some attorneys have begun
      identifying themselves as elder law specialists. Most of these do not
      specialize in all of the areas covered by the broad term elder law.
      Therefore, you should ask which areas an attorney handles.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Prepare for Your Attorney Meetings</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    Come prepared with all of the necessary information and papers. Ask
    questions to make sure that you are providing everything the attorney needs.
    Think about your legal problem and gather the information your attorney will
    need. Write down the names, addresses, and phone numbers of other people
    involved in the case. Write down the important events or facts. Bring any
    relevant papers such as contracts, letters, court notices, or leases. Keep
    copies of this information and provide it to your attorney. The more work
    you do to prepare, the less time your attorney needs to spend and charge you
    for finding the information.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Answer Your Attorney's Questions Fully</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    Your communications to your attorney are confidential. Pay close attention
    to the questions your attorney asks you and offer complete and honest
    answers. If you are not sure if a piece of information is relevant, ask your
    attorney. If your attorney knows all the facts as early as possible in the
    case, it will save time and money that might be spent later on further
    investigation or misdirected case development.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>If the Situation Changes, Tell Your Attorney as Soon as Possible</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    You are the primary source of information about your case and your attorney
    will act based on the information you have provided. If something happens or
    if you find out new information which may affect your case, give the
    information to your attorney quickly. It may change what he or she is doing
    on your case. It may save the attorney's time and your money or save the
    attorney from heading in the wrong direction on a case.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Maximize the Value of Your Contacts with Your Attorney</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    Keep in mind that you will pay for virtually every minute you spend with
    your attorney. Consolidate your questions or information-giving into a
    single call. Pass on information in writing or to other office staff rather
    than speaking directly with the attorney, unless you have a specific reason
    to do so.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="caution">
    <p>
      <strong>Caution:</strong> While a friendly relationship can facilitate the
      handling of your case, limit phone calls and meetings to the business of
      the case. You do not want to pay for a long, friendly conversation about
      other matters.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Examine Your Bill</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    Request that your attorney bill you on a regular basis. Even if you have
    agreed on a contingency fee and will not actually pay the expenses until the
    case is settled, you should periodically examine the expenses. Question any
    items that you do not understand or that are not covered in your fee
    agreement.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="caution">
    <p>
      <strong>Caution:</strong> Your attorney may list the cost of attending
      continuing legal education seminars in the area of your case. Unless you
      have agreed to cover these costs, you should question this entry.

  <h3 class="cellcolor">
    <a name="7"></a>Step 7: Define Your Relationship And Stay Involved
  </h3>

  <p>
    In films or television, a client simply tells the attorney of the problem
    and the attorney, without regard for expenses or further consultation,
    solves the case. In real life, a partnership is necessary. You must state,
    at the outset, your expectations on how much you want the attorney to
    consult with you and which decisions (if any) he or she can make without
    consulting you. You must also discuss the details of your legal costs in the
    case.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are many variations of the attorney-client relationship, from full
    representation to having the attorney act as a "pro se coach."
  </p>

  <p>
    The bottom line is that the outcome of the case affects you much more than
    it affects your attorney. No matter what role you envision for your
    attorney, you should be the decision-maker on all major points in your case.
    An attorney is hired for his or her experience on legal procedures and
    familiarity with the appropriate court system, but the more fully informed
    you are, the better prepared you will be to make the necessary key decisions
    and to oversee the work of your attorney.
  </p>

  <p>
    At a minimum, educate yourself about the general area of law relevant to
    your case by reviewing one of the many self-help legal manuals and gathering
    information from the attorney interviews you conduct. You can find out about
    courtroom procedures from staff at the court (although they may be
    reluctant), legal aid staff, or the law library or your public library.
  </p>

  <p>
    Further, you can support the attorney by gathering documents and performing
    other agreed upon tasks. It may be wise both financially and in terms of
    your staying involved in the case for you to undertake certain tasks to
    support the work on your case. There are various tasks in the development of
    any case which do not require specialized legal expertise, e.g., compiling
    information, researching regulations or company policy, obtaining birth
    certificates or other documents, or reviewing the factual portions of
    documents prepared for court.
  </p>

  <p>
    In making the decision about the degree of your involvement, ask yourself
    the following questions:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>How much time and effort can I realistically contribute?</li>
    <li>
      How much do I need to control (monitor) the day-to-day direction of the
      case?
    </li>
    <li>How familiar am I with this area of the law?</li>
    <li>How much is this case worth to me (financially)?</li>
    <li>How important is the outcome?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You will need to have a clear agreement with your attorney about your
    relative roles and expectations. On one hand, your involvement should not
    hinder the attorney from exercising the expertise for which you hired the
    attorney. On the other, all options should be explained to you in clear
    language. Ask questions about the relative merits of a proposed step until
    you understand it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Be wary of an attorney who makes strategic decisions without you, or who
    presents a proposed next step as necessary without explaining its merits and
    costs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here is a list of questions to be addressed, which can serve as a guideline:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        Do you want your attorney to act as pro se coach or as your
        representative? What work can you provide on the case? How frequently do
        you want to receive a billing (or a list of expenses if a contingency
        fee)?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Do you want to review copies of pleadings (court papers) before they are
        filed? Receive copies after they are filed? Review some but not all
        documents? Which ones?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        How often is it appropriate to meet? What benchmark should trigger a
        meeting?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        How often do you want to talk to the attorney or receive a case update?
        Can staff convey the message? Will a short note be sufficient?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Are there spending limits or benchmark figures for expenses or fees
        which should trigger a client consultation before going ahead on the
        case?
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="8"></a>Elder Law</h3>

  <p>
    Many attorneys who specialize in the elder law area are familiar with the
    other professionals (such as ombudsmen, social workers, geriatric care
    managers, or other elder care professionals) who can provide related
    services to older people. They may also be trained in the mental and
    physical effects of the normal aging process.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>What Elder Law Includes</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>The broad range of legal areas covered by "elder law" includes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Estate planning,</em> including the management of an estate during
        the person's lifetime and planning how the estate will be divided upon
        the person's death through wills, trusts, asset transfers, tax planning,
        and other methods.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Long-term care planning,</em> including nursing home issues such as
        quality of care, admissions contracts, prevention of spousal
        impoverishment, and resident's rights. It also includes life care or
        retirement community issues such as evaluating the proposed
        plan/contract.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Retirement issues,</em> including Social Security (retirement and
        disability and survivors' benefits) and other public pensions (veterans,
        civil service) and benefits as well as private pension benefits.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Health care issue</em>, including Medicare, Medicaid, Medigap
        insurance, and long-term care insurance.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Housing issues,</em> including home equity conversion and age
        discrimination.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Planning for possible incapacity</em>, by choosing in advance how
        health care and financial decisions will be made if you are unable to do
        so (methods include durable powers of attorney, health-care powers of
        attorney, living wills, and other means of delegating the decision
        making). The attorney may also be able to advise on conservatorship and
        guardianship proceedings in the event that the elder has not planned for
        incapacity.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Age discrimination issues</em> including bringing cases under the
        Age Discrimination in Employment Act.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Today most lawyers limit their practices to a few areas such as domestic
    relations, criminal law, personal injury, estate planning and probate, real
    estate, or tax issues. Even attorneys who list themselves as elder law
    specialists are unlikely to be expert in all the areas detailed above.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Do You Need An Elder Law Specialist?</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    The answer depends on your situation. If you already have a good working
    relationship with an attorney, discuss your particular legal needs with that
    attorney. Ask about your lawyer's experience in the issues typical of elder
    law. If the attorney is experienced in the areas of most concern to you, it
    is unlikely you will wish to go elsewhere. If the attorney is unfamiliar
    with elder law issues, ask the attorney for a referral or visit the
    <a href="http://www.naela.org"
      >National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys (NAELA)</a
    >
    website (more information below).
  </p>

  <p>
    Another reason you may want to seek out an elder law specialist is that
    finding the best solution is likely to involve a variety of other
    professionals such as physicians, home care agency workers, geriatric care
    managers, bank officers, and long-term care ombudsmen. An attorney familiar
    with this network can be very helpful. If needed, the attorney can act as a
    legal representative (fiduciary) if a client becomes incapacitated. Elder
    law specialists may work closely with financial planners, social workers, or
    geriatric care managers. This can be an advantage for many clients as a
    number of elder law issues involve both legal and non-legal solutions.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="note">

      appropriate technical expertise and experience regardless of how the

  <h2>The Area Agency on Aging</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    The Older Americans Act (OAA) requires your state office on aging to fund a
    local Area Agency on Aging (AAA) program that provides free legal help on
    non-criminal matters to people age 60 and over. Most of the over 385 local
    AAAs in 41 states set aside funds to provide free legal assistance for those
    older persons who are in the greatest social and economic need.
  </p>

  <p>
    OAA legal services advocates provide representation in court or at
    administrative hearings, community education, and self-help publications.
    The OAA programs offer other types of assistance and services as well. For
    example, an advocate may assist an older person with a food stamp appeal and
    arrange for transportation to a nutrition site. The OAA legal services
    programs do a great deal of outreach to the community. Some attorneys spend
    as much as half of their time speaking at senior centers or visiting people
    in their own homes.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are no income guidelines that clients must meet in order to qualify
    for services. However, the legal services provider and the Area Agency on
    Aging may set priorities about the preferred type of representation, such as
    obtaining government benefits and may not be able to provide help in cases
    the agency considers to be a lower priority.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is no cost to eligible clients. OAA legal services providers handle
    civil (not criminal) matters for people age 60 or older regardless of
    income. Local offices set priorities for the types of cases they will
    handle. Not all cases can be handled.
  </p>

  <p>
    Programs or offices providing free legal help to older persons can be
    identified by calling your local Area Agency on Aging listed in the
    government section of the telephone directory.
