    <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="1"></a>How can I spot a rip-off?</h3>

    <p>
      By taking the following precautions, you can spot a scam and avoid being
      ripped off.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Don't allow yourself to be pushed into a hurried decision. At least 99
          percent of everything that's a good deal today will still be a good
          deal a week from now.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Always request written information, by mail, about the product,
          service, investment or charity and about the organization that's
          offering it.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Don't make any investment or purchase you don't fully understand.
          Swindlers try to convince individuals that they are making an informed
          decision.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Ask what state or federal agencies the firm is regulated by, and
          contact the agency. If the firm says it's not subject to any
          regulation, you may want to act cautiously.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If an investment or major purchase is involved, request that
          information also be sent to your accountant, financial advisor,
          banker, or attorney for evaluation and an opinion.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Before you make a final financial commitment, ask for a copy of the
          refund policy and make sure it's in writing.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Beware of testimonials that you may have no way of checking out.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Never provide your credit card number and bank account information
          over the phone.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        If necessary, hang up or walk away. If you hear your own better judgment
        whispering that you may be making a serious mistake, just say good-bye.
      </li>
    </ul>

      <a name="2"></a>What should I know about Internet fraud?
    </h3>

    <p>
      Internet crime such as identity theft and online fraud exceeded $6.9
      billion in losses in 2021 according to an Internet Crime Complaint Center
      (IC3) estimate. It only gets worse every year and underscores the fact
      that both legitimate businesses and scam artists alike have equal access
      to the Internet. Among the 2021 complaints received, ransomware, business
      e-mail compromise (BEC) schemes, and the criminal use of cryptocurrency
      are among the top incidents reported, according their 2021 annual report.
    </p>

    <p>
      How can you avoid being snared by Internet fraud? Simple. If it sounds too
      good to be true, it is. Claims of "quick profits", "guaranteed returns",
      "double your investment", or "risk-free investment" probably indicate a
      fraudulent investment.
    </p>

    <!-- <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p> -->

    <h3 class="cellcolor">
      <a name="3"></a>What are some of the Internet scams I should watch out
      for?
    </h3>

    <p>
      New scams appear every year, but usually with the same themes. Here are a
      few of them:
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Refund Scam.</strong> This is the most frequent IRS-impersonation
      scam seen by the IRS. In this phishing scam, a bogus email claiming to
      come from the IRS tells the consumer that he or she is eligible to receive
      a tax refund for a specified amount. It may use the phrase "last annual
      calculations of your fiscal activity."
    </p>

    <p>
      To claim the tax refund, the consumer must open an attachment or click on
      a link contained in the e-mail to access and complete a claim form. The
      form requires the entry of personal and financial information. Several
      variations on the refund scam have claimed to come from the Exempt
      Organizations area of the IRS or the name and signature of a genuine or
      made-up IRS executive. In reality, taxpayers do not complete a special
      form to obtain their federal tax refund because refunds are triggered by
      the tax return they submitted to the IRS.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong> Lottery winnings or cash consignment.</strong> These advance fee
      scam e-mails claim to come from the Treasury Department to notify
      recipients that they'll receive millions of dollars in recovered funds or
      lottery winnings or cash consignment if they provide certain personal
      information, including phone numbers, via return e-mail. The e-mail may be
      just the first step in a multi-step scheme, in which the victim is later
      contacted by telephone or further e-mail and instructed to deposit taxes
      on the funds or winnings before they can receive any of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alternatively, they may be sent a phony check of the funds or winnings and
      told to deposit it but pay 10 percent in taxes or fees. Thinking that the
      check must have cleared the bank and is genuine, some people comply.
      However, the scammers, not the Treasury Department, will get the taxes or
      fees. In reality, the Treasury Department does not become involved in
      notification of inheritances or lottery or other winnings.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Romance Scams. </strong> Scammers sometimes use online dating and
      social networking sites to try to convince people to send money in the
      name of love. In a typical scenario, the scam artist creates a fake
      profile, gains the trust of an online love interest, and then asks that
      person to wire money, typically to a location outside the United States.
    </p>

    <p>
      Warning signs of a romance or online dating scam include wanting to leave
      the dating site immediately and use personal e-mail or IM accounts,
      claiming feelings of instant love, planning to visit, but being unable to
      do so because of a tragic event, and asking for money to pay for travel,
      visas or other travel documents, medication, a child or other relative's
      hospital bills, recovery from a temporary financial setback, or expenses
      while a big business deal comes through.

      <a name="4"></a>How can I prevent the illegal use of my credit card or
      Social Security number?
    </h3>

    <p>
      Criminals and con artists use many scams to target unsuspecting people who
      have access to money. Consumer scams happen on the phone, through the
      mail, e-mail, or over the internet. They can occur in person, at home, or
      at a business.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is a U.S. government
      agency that makes sure banks, lenders, and other financial companies treat
      you fairly, suggests these six tips for consumers to protect themselves
      from scams:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Don't share account numbers or passwords for bank accounts, credit
          cards, or Social Security.</strong
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Never pay upfront for a promised prize.</strong> Itâ€™s a scam if
        you are told that you must pay fees or taxes to receive a prize or other
        financial windfall.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >After hearing a sales pitch, take time to compare prices. </strong
        >Ask for information in writing and read it carefully.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Too good to be true?</strong> Ask yourself why someone is trying
        so hard to give you a "great deal." If it sounds too good to be true, it
        probably is.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Watch out for deals that are only "good today" and that pressure you
          to act quickly. </strong
        >Walk away from high-pressure sales tactics that don't allow you time to
        read a contract or get legal advice before signing. Also, don't fall for
        the sales pitch that says you need to pay immediately, for example by
        wiring the money or sending it by courier.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Put your number on the National Do Not Call Registry.</strong>
        Go to <a href="https://www.donotcall.gov/">Do Not Call Registry</a> or
        call (888) 382-1222.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      "Application fraud" occurs when a thief uses your name, Social Security
      number, address, and, perhaps, credit references to apply for credit. They
      can get much of this information from public sources (e.g., Who's Who
      Directories), from someone who has access to credit files (e.g., employees
      of car dealerships, department stores, or credit bureaus), from personal
      checks, or from stolen wallets.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another form of application fraud involves the interception of the
      preapproved credit card offers in the mail. The thief fills out the
      application and either changes the address or steals the credit card out
      of your mailbox when it arrives at your address.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="tip">
      <p>
        If you find a bill that you do not believe belongs to you on your credit
        report, check it out immediately. First, contact the creditor to find
        out if they have an account in your name. Ask to see a copy of the
        original application if they say you do.

      <a name="5"></a>How trustworthy are "credit clinics" and other
      organizations that claim to help me out of financial trouble?
    </h3>

    <p>
      Consumers with credit problems have paid millions of dollars to firms that
      claim they can "remove negative information," "clean up credit reports,"
      and allow consumers to get credit no matter how bad the credit history.
      Consumers should beware of the following promises by credit clinics:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          "Based on little-known loopholes in Federal credit laws, we can show
          you how to clean up your credit report!"
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The loopholes are the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA),
      under which you have the right to challenge information in your credit
      report you believe incorrect.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          "We can show you how to remove negative information from your file
          including judgments."
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      No matter how quickly you may pay off outstanding bills, creditors are
      under no obligation to remove negative information from your file.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          "We can get you a major credit card even if you've been through
          bankruptcy!"
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You will have to "secure" the card first by putting a deposit in the bank
      and getting a bank card with a credit limit based on a percentage of that
      deposit. Why should you pay the credit clinic just to provide an
      application and deposit slip?
    </p>

    <p>
      Check with your state attorney general's office to determine if your state
      has laws that protect consumers against credit clinics and contact your
      state Attorney General, consumer protection agency, or Better Business
      Bureau to check an organization's reputation.

      Advertisements touting access to little-known sources of federal

      or by contacting the agency's local or regional office. Furthermore, the

      <a name="7"></a>How can I protect myself from penny stock scams?
    </h3>

    <p>
      Penny stocks are common shares of small public companies that trade at
      less than $1.00 per share. They are considered to be highly speculative
      and high risk and are traded over the counter and are prime targets for
      price manipulation. Here is how a penny stock scam might operate:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="example">
      <p>
        Mrs. G got a call from Mr. S, who told her he wanted to help her out
        with a "little-known" investment bonanza. These penny stocks' prices
        could rise by 25 percent in a few months. After she was told to act
        before the opportunity vanished, Mrs. G invested $5,000 in the penny
        stocks. Result: She is still trying to get back her $5,000.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although she was told during the first few weeks that the stock was
        going up, within a month the seller was not returning her phone calls.
        She could not check the price of the stock because penny stocks are not
        traded on an exchange, but over-the-counter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, the price of the penny stock was not published anywhere. Mr.
        S's company was the only seller of these particular penny stocks and had
        been engaging in price manipulation. Eventually, Mrs. G. turned the case
        over to her attorney. Half of her $5,000 went in the markup of the penny
        stock's actual price and hidden commissions.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Penny stocks can be a legitimate investment opportunity if you learn to be
      alert, but with the proliferation of the Internet, these stocks are often
      quite risky for the average investor. Learn the following warning signs
      investigate before you invest.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Warning Sign #1: Unsolicited Telephone Calls</strong></p>

    <p>
      Beware of a salesperson who promises you quick profits with little or no
      risk.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Warning Sign #2: High-Pressure Sales Tactics </strong></p>

    <p>These tactics include the following statements by a salesperson:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The salesperson has "inside" information on a stock and that you
          should purchase now, before the information becomes public
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          For only for a short period of time, a stock sells at a special or
          below market price
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Due to a series of increases in a stock's price, you should purchase
          immediately
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          You may buy a particular stock only if you agree to buy stock of
          another company
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong
        >Warning Sign #3: Inability to Sell Your Stock and Receive Cash</strong
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      Fraudulent penny stock brokers may become inaccessible when you want to
      sell, or they may refuse to sell your stock unless you buy another one.

      <a name="8"></a>How can I protect myself from a pyramid scheme?
    </h3>

    <p>
      The best way to protect yourself is to understand how pyramid schemes
      operate, as this example shows:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="example">
      <p>
        Frank L. was phoned by a friend and offered an opportunity to "get in on
        the ground floor" of a business involving selling products to the
        public. He was told he would get a 50 percent return on his money within
        a month and how his friend had made thousands of dollars on a $1,000
        investment. Frank L. quickly accepted the offer and gave his friend
        $1,000 to buy a "distributorship" in this business.
      </p>
      <p>
        What Frank didn't know was that his friend had fallen victim to a
        pyramid scheme. Such schemes work as follows: A promoter offers
        investors "distributorships" at $1,000 each. The distributorships give
        the investor the right to sell other distributorships to friends and
        neighbors for $1,000 each, and also a right to sell some sort of
        product. Whenever an investor sells a $1,000 distributorship, he or she
        must give a percentage, usually half, to the promoter, and can keep the
        rest.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The tricky thing about pyramid schemes is that, for the first ten or
      twenty investors, they work. But, the pyramid scheme could continue to
      provide returns only in a world where there are infinite numbers of
      investors willing to invest $1,000, and willing (and able) to sell
      distributorships to others. Returns depend totally on new investors making
      an investment rather than on any business venture.
    </p>

    <p>
      Result: Because Frank had no sales ability, he was unable to unload even
      one distributorship, and thus the $1,000 was lost. He is currently trying
      to get his money back and has reported the investment to the SEC.

      <a name="9"></a>How can I protect myself from a Ponzi scheme?
    </h3>

    <p>
      Named for Charles A. Ponzi, who defrauded hundreds of investors in the
      1920s, a Ponzi scheme pays off old "investors" with money coming in from
      new "investors."
    </p>

    <blockquote class="example">
      <p>
        Investor A gives Promoter ("P") $1,000 on P's promise to repay $1,000
        plus $100 "interest" in 90 days. During the 90 days, P makes similar
        promises to Investors B and C, receiving $1,000 each from them. At the
        end of the first 90 day period, P may offer to pay A the $100 "interest"
        and to return the original $1,000.
      </p>
      <p>
        More likely, he will invite A to "re-invest" the $1000 plus the $100
        "interest" for a similar, or higher, return at the end of another 90
        days. Thereafter, A, believing s/he can receive a good return on the
        investment, is likely to bring other investors to P.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      P collects a pool of money that he pays out to those wishing a return on
      their invested money. Eventually, P. either disappears with all the
      "investments" or reveals that the investments went "sour."
    </p>

    <p>
      A major factor in the eventual collapse of a Ponzi scheme is that there is
      no significant source of "income" other than from new investors.

      <a name="10"></a>How can I protect myself from travel scams?
    </h3>

    <p>
      Since travel services usually have to be paid for in advance, disreputable
      individuals and companies try to sell travel packages turn out to be
      different from what was presented. If you receive an offer by phone or
      mail for a free or extremely low-priced vacation trip to a popular

      <li>Are you asked to give your credit card number over the phone?</li>

      <li>Are you pressured to make an immediate decision?</li>

      <li>
        Is the carrier simply identified as "a major airline", or does the
        representative offer a collection of airlines without being able to say
        which one you will be on?
      </li>

      <li>
        Is the representative unable or unwilling to give you a street address
        for the company?
      </li>

      <li>
        Finally, you are told you can't leave for at least two months? (The
        deadline for disputing a credit card charge is within 60 days of the
        charge appearing on your credit card statement and most scam artists
        know this.)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>

    <p>
      If you encounter any of these symptoms, ask for written information and
      time to think it over. If they say no, this probably isn't the trip for
      you. Furthermore, if you are told that you've won a free vacation, make
      sure you don't have to buy expensive hotel arrangements in order to get
      it.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are seriously considering the vacation offer, compare it to what
      you might obtain elsewhere. The appeal of free airfare or free
      accommodations often disguises the fact that the total price exceeds that
      of a regular package tour. Get written confirmation of the departure date.
      If the package involves standby or waitlist travel, or a reservation that
      can only be provided much later, ask if your payment is refundable if you
      want to cancel. If the destination is a beach resort, ask the seller how
      far the hotel is from the beach. Then ask the hotel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Determine the complete cost of the trip in dollars, including all service
      charges, taxes, processing fees, etc. If you decide to buy the trip,
      paying by credit card gives you certain legal rights to pursue a
      chargeback (credit) if promised services aren't delivered.

      <a name="11"></a>When buying a used car, how can I avoid buying a "lemon?"
    </h3>

    <p>
      Laundered lemons-used cars with serious defects, sold to unsuspecting new
      buyers are still being sold in alarming numbers. To avoid buying a
      "laundered lemon", take these steps.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Do your research. </strong> Check Consumer Reports and Edmunds
      online. Both publish car reviews and are good sources for finding out
      whether a vehicle is reliable and has been trouble-free.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Check for defects, repairs, and recalls. </strong> Visit the
      <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls">federal government's databases</a>
      to find out whether the vehicle (make and model) you're interested in has
      been recalled, as well as service bulletins, safety investigations, and
      owner complaints. Check with your local dealer's service department to
      verify that the problem (if there was one) was taken care of.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Inspect the Vehicle. </strong> Conduct a thorough visual
      inspection inside and out. Look for signs of rust, mildew on carpeting,
      fluid leaks, bodywork repairs such as mismatched paint, and wear on tires.
      With the engine running check the exhaust smoke color and smell. Verify
      that the horn and lights are all working properly. Finally, have a
      reliable mechanic look it over. While it might cost a few bucks, he will
      be able to spot things you can't.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Vehicle History Report. </strong> If you know the car's VIN
      (Vehicle Identification Number), visit
      <a href="http://www.carfax.com">CarFax</a> and enter it into their
      database to obtain a vehicle history report. The report will show you
      whether there are title problems, what the ownership history of the
      vehicle is, service records, and whether the vehicle has been involved in
      any accidents. The VIN is located on the driver's side dashboard.
    </p>

    <p>Also consider the following:</p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Beware of used cars with low mileage. These may be described as demo
          models or program cars, but may in fact be lemons.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Try to get in touch with the previous owner, via the car's title. In
          some states, the title will tell you whether the car was a lemon-law
          vehicle.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Beware of cars that come from another state.</p></li>
    </ul>

      <a name="12"></a>How can I avoid being ripped off by auto mechanics?
    </h3>

    <p>
      It is estimated that anywhere from one-quarter to one-half of the $90
      billion Americans spend every year on car repairs is wasted on the
      following scams:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Only dealerships can perform maintenance.</strong>
          This is not true. As long as you keep thorough records and the
          mechanic uses the correct fluids for your make and model, car
          maintenance can be performed by any mechanic without affecting your
          warranty. The only dealership-required service is warranty-related
          repairs and recalls.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>XYZ part will cost you $900.</strong>
          If a mechanic tells you that you need an extensive repair or any large
          component, get a second opinion or two.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong
            >Being charged to replace different parts to fix the same
            problem.</strong
          >
          This usually indicates that the mechanic is having trouble diagnosing
          the problem. That may be the case, but you shouldn't be charged for
          it.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>The Secret Warranty.</strong> Always ask a dealership service
          department whether a problem is covered by a manufacturer's warranty.
          (A manufacturer that discovers a widespread defect will often notify a
          dealership that repairs of the defect will be covered by the
          manufacturer.) There are only five states - California, Connecticut,
          Maryland, Virginia, and Wisconsin - in which it is illegal for a
          dealership not to tell you a repair is covered by a warranty.
        </p>
      </li>
      <blockquote class="tip">
        <p>
          If the defect is safety-related, you can call 800-424-9393 for a list
          of warranties and recalls or visit
          <a href="https://www.safercar.gov/">SaferCar.gov</a>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Flushing the engine.</strong> In general, the engine doesn't
          need to be flushed except for routine coolant replacement associated
          with normal maintenance.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>The $9.95 Tune-Up.</strong> A common scam is to lure customers
          with an extremely low-priced oil-change or other service deal, and
          then to discover nonexistent problems while the car is on the lift.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Double Billing.</strong> You might be told, for example, that
        you need repairs done on your brakes, and then discover that you have
        been billed for several extra items, which are actually part of the
        brake repair job.

      <a name="13"></a>How can I avoid being pick-pocketed?
    </h3>

    <p>
      These tips on how to avoid becoming the victim of a con artist or
      pickpocket are provided by the New York City Police Department's Special
      Frauds Squad.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Use handbags that have a zipper and locking flap and carry them
          securely with the flap side close to your body.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Carry wallets inside your coat or side trouser pockets, never in your
          back pants pocket.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Beware of loud arguments or commotions in crowded areas. Thieves
          working together may stage these incidents to distract you while your
          pocket is picked.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Be aware that a pickpocket may bump or crowd you on public
          transportation.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If your pocket is picked, call out immediately to warn the driver or
          conductor. Alert everyone that there's a pickpocket on board, and
          don't be afraid to shout.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Avoid crowding in the area of the subway car doors when entering or
          exiting.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Be on guard if a stranger directs your attention to a substance or
          stain on your clothes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Be on guard while doing your banking at an automatic teller machine.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Be suspicious if you are approached by a stranger who claims to have
          just found an envelope full of money or tells you he has a winning
          lottery ticket with him. This could be the first step in a confidence
          crime, with you as the victim. Never discuss your personal finances
          with strangers, and don't draw money out of the bank at a stranger's
          suggestion in order to build trust in such a situation
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Being aware of the most current scams is the best way to prevent falling
      prey to them. If you or someone you know has been a victim of a con
      artist, call your local police precinct immediately.
