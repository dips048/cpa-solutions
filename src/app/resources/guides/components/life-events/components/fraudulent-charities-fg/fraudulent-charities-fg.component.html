    Giving to a charity is a worthy objective. However, for you and society to
    get the maximum benefit from your contribution, you need to give wisely and
    make sure that your contribution serves the intended purpose.

    If you aren't completely knowledgeable about your intended charities, you
    should review their operations and practices before giving. Even if the
    charity is a household name, its practices may be wasteful. For example, a
    major part of its receipts from contributors may be used not for charitable
    purposes but to pay an outside fundraiser.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unfortunately, many charities go beyond wasteful practices and are outright
    frauds. This Financial Guide will discuss how the various states and the IRS
    regulate charities to minimize the abuses in this area and explains how to
    files a complaint against a phony charity.

  <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="1"></a>How the States Regulate Charities</h3>

  <p>
    Most state governments regulate charitable organizations. To obtain
    information on these regulations, which vary from state to state, contact
    the appropriate government agency (usually a division of the Attorney
    General or the Secretary of State). State government agencies do not approve
    charities. However, they do require charities to follow certain regulations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most states have registration and licensing rules requiring charities to
    file certain basic information, such as the official name, principal
    address, and purpose of the organization. This requirement generally applies
    to most charities, whether national or local, that solicit in the state.
  </p>

  <p>
    Annual reporting is also a common state requirement and generally involves
    the filing of the charity's financial statements. In many cases, a copy of
    the charity's federal tax return (IRS Form 990) is accepted by the state as
    fulfilling its annual reporting requirements.

      Churches and other religious organizations, as well as small charities

      from state registration and annual reporting requirements.

  <p>
    Some states have specific regulations for professional fund-raisers used by
    charities. They may require the fund-raiser to register with the state and
    put up a bond ranging from $2,500 to $50,000 to reimburse the state for any
    fines and/or penalties imposed on the fundraiser.

      registration and to obtain financial information on a soliciting charity.

  <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="2"></a>How the IRS Regulates Charities</h3>

  <p>
    To obtain tax-exempt status under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue
    Code, an organization has to file certain documents with the IRS that prove
    it is organized and operated for specified charitable purposes. The IRS
    looks at these documents in terms of whether they meet the Code's
    requirements; it does not judge charities' worthiness.
  </p>

  <p>
    Organizations with 501(c)(3) status are those that the IRS considers
    charitable, educational, religious, scientific or literary, those that
    prevent cruelty to animals, and those that foster national or international
    sports competition. When the IRS rules positively on an application, the
    organization is eligible to receive contributions deductible as charitable
    donations for federal income tax purposes. The charity receives a
    Determination Letter formally notifying it of its charitable status. Older
    charities may have a 101(6) ruling, which corresponds to Section 501(c)(3)
    of the current IRC. Churches and small charities with less than $5,000 of
    annual income do not have to apply to the IRS for exemption.

    You can obtain three documents on a specific charity by sending a written
    request to the attention of the Disclosure Officer at your nearest IRS
    District Office. The IRS will charge a per-page copying fee for these items.
    To speed your request, have the full, official name of the charity, as well
    as the city and state location. These three publicly available documents
    are:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <em>Form 1023</em>: the application filed by the charity to obtain
      tax-exempt status.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>IRS Letter of Determination</em>: the two-page IRS letter that
      notifies the organization of its tax-exempt status.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Form 990</em>: the financial/income tax form filed with the IRS
      annually by the charity. (Charities with a gross income of less than
      $25,000 and churches are not required to file this form). Among other
      things, Form 990 includes information on the charity's income, expenses,
      assets, liabilities and net assets in the past fiscal year. Form 990 also
      identifies the salaries of the charity's five highest-paid employees. When
      contacting the IRS for copies, specify the fiscal year.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      If your request for information involves only Forms 990, you can get a
      faster response by writing directly to the IRS Service Center where the
      charity files its return. Contact your nearest IRS office for the address
      of the appropriate Service Center.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The charity registration office in your state (usually a division of the
    state attorney general's office) may also have a copy of the charity's
    latest Form 990, along with other publicly available information on
    charities soliciting in your state.
  </p>

  <p>
    A charity's application for tax-exempt status and its annual Form 990 must
    be made available for public inspection during regular business hours at the
    principal office of the charity and at each of its regional or district
    offices containing three or more employees. Although the charity is not
    required to provide photocopies of the return, it must have a copy on hand
    for public inspection.

  <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="3"></a>How to File a Complaint</h3>

  <p>
    Complaints about charities are uncommon. However, if sweepstakes prizes,
    membership benefits, the charity's magazine, or ordered merchandise is not
    received, donors may need to file complaints. Donors may also be concerned
    about duplicate mailings from the same charity or may wish to remove their
    names from the charity's mailing list.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Here is how to file a complaint:</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Put your complaint in writing. Clearly explain the problem and what
      specific action you want taken by the charity to resolve it.
    </li>
    <li>
      Include copies of all applicable documents with your complaint (for
      example, copies of canceled checks for merchandise ordered, copies of
      mailing labels in case of duplicate mailings, or copies of problem
      appeals).
    </li>
    <li>
      File your complaint with the
      <a href="https://give.org/charity-inquiry-new"
        >Better Business Bureau online</a
      >
      or by mail: BBB Wise Giving Alliance, 3033 Wilson Blvd, Suite 710,
      Arlington, VA 22201. Complaints can also be filed with government
      agencies, such as your state attorney general's office. Many states have
      consumer protection agencies and special offices to regulate charities.
    </li>
    <li>
      If your complaint involves activities, not in accordance with the
      organization's tax-exempt purposes (for example, misappropriation of
      funds) contact the IRS, as well as your state attorney general's office.
      In addition, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service investigates charges of
      false representation and violations of the mail fraud statutes.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="4"></a>Government and Non-Profit Agencies</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Most state governments regulate charitable organizations. To obtain
      information on these regulations, which vary from state to state, contact
      the appropriate government agency (usually a division of the Attorney
      General or the Secretary of State).
    </li>
    <li>
      Contact the appropriate state government agency to verify a charity's
      registration and to obtain financial information on a soliciting charity.
    </li>
    <li>
      Contact your local Better Business Bureau to find out whether a complaint
      has been lodged against a charity.
