    residence and your homeowner's policy should be chosen carefully. This
    Financial Guide discusses the policy provisions to consider when deciding
    which homeowner's insurance policy to buy to be sure that your home is
    adequately insured and that you are getting the most insurance value for
    your money.

    This Financial Guide offers guidance about homeowner's insurance such as
    what questions to ask your insurance broker or agent and how to find the
    best insurer for your needs. It also explains why you need to keep a list of
    personal possessions and provides a homeowner's inventory sheet for you to
    use to make a list of your belongings, as well as offers useful tips on how
    to qualify for a discount and helps you purchase the policy that best fits
    your needs at an affordable price.

    <a name="1"></a>What Homeowner's Insurance Generally Covers
  </h3>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      It is equally important that renters maintain insurance. Many renters
      neglect to obtain insurance, perhaps deterred by cost or perhaps, or
      because, unlike homeowners, they are not required to maintain insurance.
      Studies show that about three-quarters of all those who rent a residence
      do not have renter's insurance. Adequate replacement cost coverage and
      liability insurance can be obtained for about $200 per year--less if
      combined with an auto policy for instance since most insurers offer
      discounts for multiple policies.
    </p>

  <blockquote class="note">
    <p>Homeowner's insurance is usually required by mortgage lenders</p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>What's Covered</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    Although exact coverage and policy limits vary, homeowner's insurance
    usually covers damage caused by the following events or catastrophes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Fire</li>
    <li>Lightning</li>
    <li>Explosion</li>
    <li>Smoke</li>
    <li>Vandalism</li>
    <li>Theft, including check forgery and counterfeit currency</li>
    <li>Unauthorized use of credit cards</li>
    <li>Falling objects</li>
    <li>Ice, snow, or sleet weighing on vehicles</li>
    <li>Windstorm</li>
    <li>Hail</li>
    <li>Riot</li>
    <li>Volcano</li>
    <li>Freezing of plumbing</li>
    <li>Flooding due to plumbing overflow</li>
    <li>Hot water heater bursting</li>
    <li>Heating system malfunction</li>
    <li>Power surges</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Basic coverage may also include food spoilage, lock replacement, temporary
    repairs, and removing debris. If these items are not initially included in
    your basic coverage, it is possible to have them added.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="aid">

      homeowner's policies, see

      Commissioners' website.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    If you incur expenses for temporary living quarters because your home is
    rendered uninhabitable by an insured event/casualty, most policies will
    reimburse you in part for this so-called "loss of use."
  </p>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      Earthquakes and sinkholes are not covered under standard policies;
      however, earthquake insurance can be purchased as an endorsement for an
      additional fee in all states except California. Flood insurance, which
      also includes mudflow, must also be purchased as a separate policy. It is
      only available National Flood Insurance Program run by the federal
      government. Other types of water damage such as overflows or backups from
      a sump pump, sewer system, or drains are also excluded and require a
      separate endorsement.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    There is usually a deductible of $100 to $500 for personal property losses.
    Raising the deductible can lower the premium.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Actual Cash Value Or Replacement Cost</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    If you insure your belongings for their "actual cash value," you will not
    get their replacement value at the time of a loss. Actual cash value refers
    to the value of your belongings after taking into account depreciation and
    wear and tear. this is also known as Fair Market Value (FMV). For instance,
    the actual cash value of a television you bought ten years ago may be worth
    only $50. On the other hand, "replacement cost" coverage provides you with
    the costs to replace your belongings. Thus, you would get the $500 you need
    to replace that ten-year-old television, not the $50 "actual cash value."
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Limits on Coverage</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    You choose the limits on the amounts of coverage on your home and personal
    property. The premium you pay depends on the limits you choose. Regardless
    of the policy limit, there is a separate limit on the replacement of
    high-value items, such as jewelry and artwork. If you want increased
    coverage for certain items, you must purchase an endorsement or floater
    (also known as a "rider"). You must generally pay extra for the following:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>High-value items (e.g., jewelry, furs, silverware, weapons)</li>
    <li>Personal computers and other home-office equipment</li>
    <li>Waterbeds</li>
    <li>Business operated in the home</li>
    <li>Earthquake, flood, and hurricane (depending on location)</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p> -->

  <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="2"></a>Policy Coverage: What to Consider</h3>

  <p>
    If your home is damaged or your possessions are stolen, will your
    homeowner's policy pay as much as you are expecting? If you are willing to
    pay the premium for full protection, here are the policy coverages you might
    consider.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>100 Percent of Rebuilding Costs</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    The amount of insurance that you buy should be based on the cost of
    rebuilding--not on the price of your home. The cost of rebuilding your house
    is usually higher than the price you originally paid for it, and often, even
    the price you could sell it for today. Most insurance companies recommend
    you insure your home for 100 percent of the cost of rebuilding it.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      Your insurance agent or company representative may be able to help you
      calculate rebuilding costs. If not, you could hire an appraiser to do
      this. Real estate agents can provide you with the names of appraisers.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The cost of rebuilding is affected by local construction costs and by the
    type of house you have; however, the following are some of the factors that
    enter into the calculation:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The type of exterior wall construction such as wood frame, masonry (brick
      or stone) or veneer
    </li>
    <li>The square footage of the structure</li>
    <li>The style of the home, ranch or colonial, for example</li>
    <li>The number of bathrooms and other rooms</li>
    <li>The type of roof and materials used</li>
    <li>Whether the home was custom built</li>
    <li>
      Whether the home has an attached garage, a fireplace, exterior trim, or
      any special features such as arched or bay windows
    </li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      For a rough estimate of the cost of rebuilding your house, calculate the
      square footage and multiply it by local building costs per square foot for
      your type of house. Ask a real estate agent or appraiser for average
      building costs in your area.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    If you already have homeowner's insurance, it's very important to make sure
    that you have enough. If your home is one of the few that are totally
    destroyed, and it is insured for less than 100 percent of the rebuilding
    cost, you risk not having enough money to replace it with one of similar
    size and quality.
  </p>

  <p>
    Make sure your insurance agent or broker knows about any improvements or
    additions to your house that have been made since you last discussed your
    insurance policy. If you haven't increased your policy limits to cover the
    cost of rebuilding that new deck, a second bathroom, or other improvements
    that have increased the value of your home, then you risk being
    under-insured. If you lack sufficient insurance, your insurer may pay only a
    part of the cost of replacing or repairing damaged items--depending on the
    kind of policy you have.
  </p>

  <p>
    Look at your policy to see what the maximum amount that your insurance
    company would pay if your house was damaged and had to be rebuilt. The
    limits of the policy usually appear on the
    <strong>Declarations Page</strong> under Section 1, Coverage A Dwelling.
    Your insurance company will pay no more than this amount to rebuild your
    home--no exceptions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some banks require that you buy homeowner's insurance to cover the amount of
    your mortgage. However, if the limit of your insurance policy is based only
    on your mortgage, your policy is unlikely to cover the cost of rebuilding.
    Make certain that the value of your insurance policy keeps up with increases
    in local building costs.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="caution">
    <p>
      If the limits of your policy have not changed since you bought your home,
      it is likely that you are under-insured.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      Ask your agent about adding an "inflation guard clause," which
      automatically adjusts the limit to reflect current construction costs when
      you renew your policy.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Replacement Cost</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    Consider buying replacement cost coverage for structural damage. A
    replacement cost policy will pay for the repair or replacement of damaged
    property with materials of similar kind and quality. The insurance company
    will not deduct for depreciation. Depreciation is the decrease in value due
    to age, wear and tear, and other factors.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you own an older home, you may not be able to buy a replacement cost
    policy. Instead, you might buy a modified replacement cost policy that will
    pay for repairs using standard building materials and construction
    techniques in use today, rather than repairing or replacing features typical
    of older homes, like plaster walls and wooden doors, with similar materials.
  </p>

  <p>
    Insurance companies differ greatly in the way they insure older homes. Some
    refuse to insure older homes for 100 percent of replacement cost because of
    the expense of re-creating special features like wall and ceiling moldings
    and carvings. Other companies will insure older homes for 100 percent of
    replacement cost as long as the dwelling is in good condition.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="caution">
    <p>
      If you cannot insure your home for 100 percent of replacement cost--or
      choose not to do so--because the cost of replacing a large old home is
      prohibitive, then make sure the limits of the policy are high enough to
      provide you with a house of acceptable size and quality.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Guaranteed Replacement Cost Insurance</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    A guaranteed replacement cost policy will pay whatever it costs to rebuild
    your home as it was before the fire or another disaster, even if it exceeds
    the policy limit. This policy protects you against sudden increases in
    construction costs due to a shortage of building materials, for example, or
    other unexpected situations, but generally, does not cover the cost of
    upgrading the house to comply with building codes.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      Building codes require structures to be built to minimum standards. If
      your home is severely damaged, there may be an extra cost in rebuilding it
      to comply with standards enacted since the home was built. Complying with
      building code may require a change in design or building materials.
      Generally, homeowner's insurance policies will not pay for this extra
      expense, but some insurers offer an endorsement (a form attached to an
      insurance policy that changes what the policy covers) that pays a
      specified amount toward these costs.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote class="note">
    <p>
      A guaranteed replacement cost policy may not be available if you own an
      older home.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Flood Insurance</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    If your home is located in an area prone to flooding, contact your insurance
    agent or the National Flood Insurance Program (800-427-4661).
  </p>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      Your homeowner's insurance policy does not cover flood damage. If you buy
      a federal government flood insurance policy, consider insuring your home
      for 100 percent of replacement cost and buying insurance to cover the
      contents of your home as well as the dwelling.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Contents Insurance</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    This list should include everything you and other members of your household
    own in your home and in other buildings on the property, except your car and
    certain boats, which must be insured separately. Among the items you should
    include are indoor and outdoor furniture, appliances, stereos, computers and
    other electronic equipment, hobby materials and recreational equipment,
    china, linens, silverware and kitchen equipment, and jewelry, clothing and
    other personal belongings.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      Estimate the value of your personal possessions at current prices and not
      what you paid for it. The total is the amount of insurance you would need
      to replace the contents of your home with new items if everything was
      destroyed.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Check your homeowner's policy to find out how much insurance you have for
    the contents of your home. The limit of the policy is shown on the
    Declarations Page under Section 1, Coverage, Personal Property. The contents
    limit generally is 50 percent of the amount of insurance on the dwelling.
    For example, on a home insured for $100,000 the contents would be limited to
    $50,000. Now compare the contents limit with the total value of the items on
    your list of personal possessions. If you think you are under-insured, give
    your insurance agent or broker a call.
  </p>

  <p>
    As discussed before, there are two ways of insuring your personal
    possessions. If you have a homeowner's insurance policy, find out whether
    claim payments for damage to your personal property would be based on
    replacement cost or actual cash value. Check your policy under Section 1,
    Conditions, Loss Settlement or ask your agent. As with insurance for the
    structure, a replacement cost policy pays the dollar amount needed to
    replace a damaged item with one of similar kind and quality without
    deductions for depreciation. An actual cash value policy pays the amount
    needed to replace the item minus depreciation.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Special Limits</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    Check the limits on certain kinds of personal possessions, such as jewelry,
    art, silverware, and furs. This information is in Section 1, Personal
    Property, Special Limits of Liability. Some insurance companies also place a
    limit on what they'll pay for computers and other home office equipment. If
    the limits are too low, consider buying a special personal property
    endorsement or rider.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="note">
    <p>
      An endorsement is an addition to your policy. A floater is a form of
      insurance that allows you to insure valuable items separately. Under a
      rider or floater, you will be able to insure these items for higher
      amounts than under a standard homeowner's policy.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      If you have a claim, the more information you have about the damaged
      items--a description of each and the date of purchase and purchase
      price--the faster the claim can usually be settled.
    </p>

    <p>
      Videotape or take photographs of rooms and their contents. Note where and
      when you bought each item and the price. Write down the brand names and
      model numbers of appliances and electronic equipment. Add new items as you
      buy them, and keep receipts with the list.
    </p>

    <p>
      Store the list, photos, and other records in a safe place outside the home
      in a bank deposit box or with a neighbor or relative so that they are not
      destroyed if your home is damaged.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <!-- <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p> -->

  <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="3"></a>Shopping For A Policy</h3>

  <p>
    The price you pay for homeowner's insurance can vary by hundreds of dollars,
    depending on the insurance company. Companies offer several types of
    discounts, but they do not offer the same discount or the same amount of
    discount in all states. Here are some things to consider when buying
    homeowner's insurance:
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Shop Around</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    Although it may take a few phone calls to shop around for the best
    insurance, you could save a few hundred dollars by taking the time to do so.
    Conduct a preliminary search by compiling a list of possible insurers. Check
    with your insurance broker or agent, ask your friends, check the Yellow
    Pages, search online, check consumer guides, and/or call your state
    insurance department. A thorough investigation of available insurers will
    give you an idea of price ranges and tell you which companies or agents have
    the lowest prices.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      Do not consider price alone. The insurer you select should offer both a
      fair price, good coverage and excellent service. Quality service may cost
      a bit more, but it provides added conveniences. Talking to insurers will
      give you a feel for the type of service they offer.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    When talking to insurers, ask them what they would do to lower your costs.
    Once you've narrowed your search to three companies, get price quotes.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Raise Your Deductibles</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    Deductibles on homeowners' policies typically start at $250. You might save
    up to 12 percent of the premium by increasing your deductible to $500, up to
    24 percent by increasing it to $1,000, up to 30 percent by going up to
    $2,500, and 37 percent by raising it to $5,000.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Considering Buying Home And Auto Policies From the Same Insurer</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    Many companies that sell homeowner's, auto and liability coverage will take
    5 to 15 percent off your premium if you buy two or more policies from them.
    This is called a multiple policy discount.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Consider Insurance Cost Before Buying A Home</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    When buying a home, don't overlook the insurance costs. These may affect the
    price you are willing to pay for the home. Among the factors to consider:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The home's construction in relation to the geographical region. For
      example, brick houses may result in less costly premiums in the East
      whereas frame houses are less costly in the West. Choosing wisely could
      cut your premium by 5 to 15 percent.
    </li>
    <li>
      Whether the area is prone to floods (if so, you will have to pay
      additional money for an endorsement). Visit
      <a href="https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance"
        >FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)</a
      >
      to determine your flood risk and find out whether you are in a flood zone.
    </li>
    <li>
      Whether the home is new or used (insurers may offer you a discount of 8 to
      15 percent for a new home).
    </li>
    <li>The electrical system, plumbing, and structure.</li>
    <li>
      Whether the town has full-time or volunteer fire service and whether the
      home is close to a hydrant or fire station (the closer it is, the lower
      your premium will be).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Don't Insure Land</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    When deciding how much homeowner's insurance to buy, do not include the
    value of the land under your house. If it is not at risk of theft,
    windstorm, fire, or other disasters, then why pay for wasted coverage?
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Increase Home Security</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    You can usually get discounts of at least 5 percent for a smoke detector,
    burglar alarm, or dead-bolt locks. Some companies offer to cut your premium
    by as much as 15 or 20 percent if you install a sophisticated sprinkler
    system and a fire and burglar alarm that rings at the police station or
    another monitoring facility. Although these discounts are incentives to
    invest in home security and yard maintenance systems, be aware that these
    systems are not inexpensive and that not every system qualifies for the
    discount.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      Before you buy an alarm system, find out what kind your insurer recommends
      and how much you'd save on premiums.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p></p>
  <h2>No Smoking Discounts</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    Insurers may offer lower premiums if all the residents in a house do not
    smoke.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Senior Discounts</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    If you are at least 55 years old and retired, you may qualify for a discount
    of up to 10 percent at some insurers.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Investigate Group Coverage</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    Employers, alumni, and business associations can often benefit from an
    insurance package at competitive rates. Ask your company's human resources
    department or your association's director if such a package is available.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Stay With the Same Insurer</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    If you've kept your coverage with one company for several years, you may get
    a reduction in your premiums of 5 or 10 percent, depending on the insurer.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Check Your Policy Once A Year</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    Compare the limits in your policy with the value of your possessions at
    least once a year to make sure your policy covers major purchases and/or
    additions to your home.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      On the other hand, you do not want to spend money for unnecessary
      coverage. If your five-year-old fur coat is no longer worth the $20,000
      you paid for it, reduce your rider and cut your premium.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Look For Private Insurance First</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    If you live in a high-risk area, that is, one that is vulnerable to coastal
    storms, fires, or crime, and have been buying your homeowner's insurance
    through a government plan, you may find that there are steps you can take to
    buy insurance at a lower price in the private market. Check with your
    insurance agent or broker.
  </p>

  <p align="center">* * * *</p>

  <p>
    To be sure you have adequate homeowner's insurance, ask your insurance agent
    questions about the issues discussed in this Financial Guide. A thorough
    inquiry into specific coverage and costs should result in a policy that
    offers the best coverage and value. It is also important to ask your agent
    or broker to explain what factors were used to calculate the policy limits
    for the dwelling.
