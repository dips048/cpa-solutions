    <p>
      Federal law, mainly the
      <a
        href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/fact-sheets/what-is-erisa"
        >Employee Retirement Income Security Act</a
      >
      (ERISA), provides you with certain safeguards and guarantees as to the
      money you have in a plan maintained by an employer. This Financial Guide
      provides the answers to the major questions you may have about your
      pension plan.
    </p>

    <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="1"></a>What Does ERISA Do For You?</h3>

    <p>
      ERISA sets minimum standards that pension plans in private industry must
      meet. Thus, if your employer maintains a pension plan, ERISA dictates, for
      example, the latest date by which you can become a participant and how
      long you may be required to work before you obtain a vested
      (nonforfeitable) interest in your pension.
    </p>

    <p>
      If not for ERISA (or some other federal or state law), plans would, for
      example, be able to require that employees work ten years before becoming
      vested in a pension plan or to require them to work five years before
      having to put in any money for them.
    </p>

    <p>
      ERISA does not force an employer to establish a pension plan. It merely
      requires that if the employer establishes a plan, the plan must meet
      ERISA's standards. The law also does not specify how much money a
      participant must be paid as a benefit.
    </p>

    <!-- <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p> -->

    <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="2"></a>What Standards Does ERISA Set?</h3>

    <p>
      ERISA does the following (these will be examined in more detail later on
      in the guide):
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong
            >Requires plans to provide participants with information about the
            plan.</strong
          >
          Participants are employees who have worked a certain length of time
          and are therefore eligible to participate in the plan.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong
            >Sets minimum standards for participation, vesting, benefit accrual
            and funding.</strong
          >
          The law defines how long a person may be required to work before
          becoming eligible to participate in a plan, to accumulate benefits,
          and to have a vested right to those benefits. The law also has
          detailed funding rules that require employer plan sponsors to provide
          adequate funding for your plan.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Requires accountability of plan fiduciaries.</strong> ERISA
          says a fiduciary is anyone who exercises discretionary authority or
          control over a plan's management or assets, including anyone who
          provides investment advice to the plan. Fiduciaries who do not follow
          the ERISA principles of conduct may be liable for restoring losses to
          the plan.
        </p>
      </li>

        <p>
          <strong
            >Gives participants the right to sue for benefits and breaches of
            fiduciary duty.</strong
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong
            >Guarantees payment of certain benefits if a defined benefit plan is
            terminated.</strong
          >
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Before we discuss what ERISA guarantees, it is important to distinguish
      among the different types of employee retirement plans, since the rights
      guaranteed with pension plans vary according to the type of plan.
      Generally speaking, there are two types of pension plans: (1) defined
      benefit plans and (2) defined contribution plans.
    </p>

    <p></p>
    <h2>What is a Defined Benefit Plan?</h2>
    <p></p>

    <p>
      A defined benefit plan, usually a traditional pension plan, promises you a
      specified monthly benefit at retirement. The plan may state this promised
      benefit as an exact dollar amount, such as $100 per month at retirement.
      Or, more commonly, it may calculate a benefit through a plan formula that
      considers such factors as salary and service, for example, one percent of
      your average salary for the last five years of employment for every year
      of service with your employer. The amount of your benefit depends on what
      is promised, not on the performance of the investments.
    </p>

    <p>
      The general rules of ERISA apply to defined benefit plans, and some
      specialized rules also apply.
    </p>

    <p></p>
    <h2>What is a Defined Contribution Plan?</h2>
    <p></p>

    <p>
      A defined contribution plan, on the other hand, does not promise you a
      specific amount of benefits at retirement. In these plans, you or your
      employer (or both) contribute to your individual account under the plan,
      sometimes at a set rate, such as five percent of your earnings annually.
    </p>

    <p>
      The contributions are invested on your behalf. When you retire, quit, or
      otherwise separate from service, you will receive the balance in your
      account, which is based on contributions plus or minus investment gains or
      losses. The value of your account will fluctuate due to changes in the
      value of your investments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Examples of defined contribution plans include 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans,
      employee stock ownership plans, and profit-sharing plans. The general
      rules of ERISA apply to each of these types of plans.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="tip">
      <p>
        To determine what type of plan your employer provides, check with your
        plan administrator or read your summary plan description.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      There are a number of variations on the defined contribution plan. These
      include (1) the Money Purchase Plan, (2) the Simplified Employee Pension
      Plan (SEP), (3) the Profit Sharing Plan and Stock Bonus Plan, (4) the 401
      (k) Plan, (5) the "Simple" IRA Plan, and (6) the Employee Stock Ownership
      Plan (ESOP). They are discussed below:
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Money Purchase Plan.</strong> A money purchase pension plan
      requires fixed annual contributions from your employer to your individual
      account. This is a type of defined contribution plan. Because a money
      purchase pension plan requires these regular contributions, the plan is
      subject to certain funding and other rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Simplified Employee Pension Plan (SEP)</strong>. Your employer may
      sponsor a Simplified Employee Pension plan (SEP). SEPs are relatively
      simple retirement savings vehicles which allow employers to make
      contributions on a tax-favored basis to individual retirement accounts
      (IRAs) owned by the employees. SEPs are subject to fewer reporting and
      disclosure requirements than other retirement plans. Under a SEP, you as
      the employee generally set up an IRA to accept your employer's
      contributions. (Sometimes the employer does this.) Your employer can
      contribute a percentage of your pay into a SEP each year.
    </p>

        >
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      <strong>Profit Sharing Plan and Stock Bonus Plan.</strong> A
      profit-sharing or stock bonus plan is a defined contribution plan under
      which the plan may provide, or the employer may determine, annually, how
      much will be contributed to the plan (out of profits or otherwise). The
      plan contains a formula for allocating to each participant a portion of
      each annual contribution. A profit sharing plan or stock bonus plan may
      include a 401(k) plan.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>401(k) Plan.</strong> Your employer may establish a defined
      contribution plan that is a cash or deferred arrangement, usually called a
      401(k) plan. You can elect to defer receiving a portion of your salary,
      which is instead contributed on your behalf, before taxes, to the 401(k)
      plan. Sometimes the employer matches your contributions. There are special
      rules governing the operation of a 401 (k) plan.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="tip">
      <p>Your employer must advise you of any limits that may apply to you.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="tip">
      <p>
        Although a 401(k) plan is a retirement plan, you may be able to access
        funds in the plan before retirement. For example, if you are an active
        employee, your plan can allow you to borrow from the plan. Also, your
        plan may permit you to make a withdrawal on account of hardship,
        generally from the funds you contributed. Sponsors cannot make your
        elective deferrals a condition for the receipt of other benefits, except
        for matching contributions.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      <strong>"Simple" Plan.</strong> Recent legislation allows self-employed
      persons and employers with 100 or fewer employees to establish "SIMPLE"
      retirement plans. The SIMPLE combines the features of an IRA and a 401(k).
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)</strong>. Employee stock
      ownership plans (ESOPs) are a form of defined contribution plan in which
      the investments are primarily in employer stock. Congress authorized the
      creation of ESOPs as one method of encouraging employee participation in
      corporate ownership.

      <a name="3"></a>What Information Does the Plan Have to Provide You With?
    </h3>

    <p>
      ERISA requires plan administrators, the people who run plans, to give you
      in writing the most important facts you need to know about your pension
      plan. Some of these facts must be provided to you regularly and
      automatically by the plan administrator. Others are available upon
      request, free-of-charge or for copying fees.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="tip">
      <p>Your request for plan information should be made in writing.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The two most important documents you are entitled to are (1) the summary
      plan description and (2) the summary annual report. The summary annual
      report is a summary of the annual financial report that most pension plans
      must file with the Department of Labor. It is available to you at no cost.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="tip">
      <p>
        To learn more about your plan's assets, ask the plan administrator for a
        copy of the annual report in its entirety.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p></p>
    <h2>What is the Summary Plan Description?</h2>
    <p></p>

    <p>
      One of the most important documents you are entitled to receive
      automatically when you become a participant of an ERISA-covered pension
      plan or a beneficiary receiving benefits under such a plan, is a summary
      of the plan, called the summary plan description (SPD). Your plan
      administrator is legally obligated to provide the SPD to you free of
      charge.
    </p>

    <p>
      The SPD tells you what the plan provides and how it operates. It tells you
      when you begin to participate in the plan, how your service and benefits
      are calculated when your benefit becomes vested when you will receive
      payment and in what form, and how to file a claim for benefits.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="tip">
      <p>
        Read your SPD to learn about the particular provisions that apply to
        you. If a plan is changed you must be informed, either through a revised
        summary plan description or in a separate document, called a summary of
        material modifications, which also must be given to you free of charge.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p></p>
    <h2>What if You Can't Obtain these Documents?</h2>
    <p></p>

    <p>
      If you are unable to get the summary plan description, the summary annual
      report, or the annual report from the plan administrator, you may be able
      to obtain a copy by writing to the Department of Labor, PWBA, Public
      Disclosure Room, Room N-5638, 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington,
      D.C. 20210, for a nominal copying charge. If possible, provide the name of
      the plan, employer identification number (a 9-digit number assigned by the
      IRS) and the plan number (a 3-digit number, such as 002). If you do not
      have this information, give the name of the plan and the city and state.
    </p>

    <p></p>
    <h2>Where Else Can I Get Plan Documents?</h2>
    <p></p>

    <p>
      Documents for some plans are available for public inspection at the IRS.
      These documents include the applications filed by pension plans to
      determine if they meet federal tax qualification requirements,
      applications filed by certain organizations to determine if they qualify
      as tax-exempt, and the IRS responses to these applications. For
      information on available documents, contact the IRS Freedom of Information
      Electronic Reading Room via their website:

        If you terminate employment and you have a vested pension benefit (see
        below for an explanation of vested benefits) that you are not eligible
        to receive until later, that information will be reported by your plan
        to the IRS, which, in turn, will inform the Social Security
        Administration. This information must also be provided to you by the

    <h3 class="cellcolor">
      <a name="4"></a>What Age and Length of Service Requirements May Your Plan
      Impose?
    </h3>

    <p>
      Generally speaking, you must be permitted to become a participant if you
      have reached age 21 and have completed one year of service. Even if you
      work part-time or seasonally, you cannot be excluded from the plan on
      grounds of age or service if you meet this service standard. You must be
      permitted to begin to participate in the plan no later than the start of
      the next plan year or six months after meeting the requirements of
      membership, whichever is earlier.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="tip">
      <p>
        You must be in the "covered" group of employees to get the benefit of
        ERISA's age and length of service guarantees. Your employer is allowed
        to provide one or more plans covering different groups of employees, or
        to exclude certain categories of employees from coverage under any plan.
        For example, your employer might sponsor one plan for salaried employees
        and another for union employees. You may not be within the group that
        the employer defines as covered by the plan.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      ERISA imposes certain other participation rules. They depend on the type
      of employer for whom you work, the type of plan your employer provides,
      and your age. For example:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        If you were an older worker when you were hired, you cannot be excluded
        from participating in the plan on grounds of age just because you are
        close to retirement age.
      </li>
      <li>
        If, upon your entry into the plan, your benefit will be immediately
        fully "vested," or non-forfeitable (see below), the plan can require
        that you complete two years of service before you become eligible to
        participate in the plan. 401 (k) plans, however, cannot require you to
        complete more than one year of service before you become eligible to
        participate.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you work for a tax-exempt educational institution and your plan
        benefit becomes vested after you earn one year of service, the plan can
        require that you be at least age 26 (instead of age 21 ) before you can
        participate in the plan.
      </li>
      <li>
        If your employer maintains a SEP, you must be permitted to participate
        if you have performed services for the employer in three of the
        immediately preceding five years.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p></p>
    <h2>How is "Service" Measured?</h2>
    <p></p>

    <p>
      ERISA has rules for how employers must measure employees' employment to
      determine how the eligibility, benefit accrual, and vesting rules apply.
      ERISA generally defines a year of service as 1,000 hours of service during
      a 12-month period. Different rules apply to counting years of service for
      purposes of eligibility, benefit accrual, and vesting.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="tip">
      <p>
        A plan basically has a choice among three methods for determining
        whether you must be credited with a year of service for participation,
        vesting, and, in some circumstances, benefit accrual: the general method
        of counting service, a simplified equivalency method, or the elapsed
        time method. Refer to your summary plan description to see which method
        is used by your plan.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p></p>
    <h2>What is Benefit Accrual and How Does it Work?</h2>
    <p></p>

    <p>
      When you participate in a pension plan, you accrue (earn) pension
      benefits. Your accrued benefit is the amount of benefit that has
      accumulated or been allocated in your name under the plan as of a
      particular point in time. ERISA generally does not set benefit levels or
      specify precisely how benefits are to accumulate.
    </p>

    <p>
      Plans may use any definition of service for purposes of benefit accrual as
      long as the definition is applied on a reasonable and consistent basis.
      Service for benefit accrual generally takes into account only the years of
      service you earn after you become a plan participant, not all service you
      have performed since you were hired by your employer. Employees who work
      less than full-time, but at least 1,000 hours per year, must be credited
      with a pro rata portion of the benefit that they would accrue if they were
      employed full-time.
    </p>

    <p>
      To illustrate: If a plan requires 2,000 hours of service for full benefit
      accrual, then a participant who works 1,000 hours must be credited with at
      least 50 percent of the full benefit accrual .
    </p>

    <p>
      A special rule applies to SEPs: all participants who earn a certain
      minimum amount in compensation from their employers are entitled to
      receive a contribution.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="tip">
      <p>
        Since ERISA generally does not regulate the amount of your benefit, you
        can estimate how much pension you are building up only by examining the
        summary plan description or the plan document. These documents should
        explain how you earn service credit for full benefit accrual each plan
        year.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <!-- <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p> -->

    <h3 class="cellcolor">
      <a name="5"></a>Are Plan Features Other Than Accrued Benefits Protected?
    </h3>

    <p>
      Your accrued benefit includes more than just the amount of benefit you
      have accumulated. Your plan provides you with various rights and options,
      some of which are protected rights attached to your benefit amount. As a
      general rule, protected rights cannot be reduced or eliminated, nor can
      they be granted or denied at your employer's discretion. If a plan feature
      you care about has been eliminated, this section is designed to help you
      determine whether it was a protected right.
    </p>

    <p>
      The rights that are protected include (1) optional forms of benefit
      payments, (2) early retirement benefits, and (3) retirement-type
      subsidies.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Optional forms of benefit payment.</strong> An example of an
          optional form of benefit that your plan may provide is the right to
          receive payment of your benefits in a lump sum payment rather than as
          an annuity.

          <strong>Early retirement benefit.</strong> ERISA does not require a
          pension plan to provide participants with the option to retire earlier
          than at the plan's normal retirement age, but if such an option is
          offered, a plan generally may not be changed to eliminate the right to
          take such an early retirement as to benefits accrued before the
          change.

          <strong>Retirement-type subsidy.</strong> Retirement-type subsidies

    <p>
      Certain important plan features are not protected, such as a Social
      Security supplement, the right to direct investments, the right to a
      particular form of investment, the right to take a loan from a plan, or
      the right to make employee contributions at a particular rate on either a

      <a name="6"></a>Can Your Plan Reduce Future Benefits?
    </h3>

    <p>
      ERISA does not prohibit your employer from amending the plan to reduce the
      rate at which benefits accrue in the future. For example, a plan that pays
      $5 in monthly benefits at age 55 for years of service through 2001, may be
      amended to provide that years of service beginning in 2002 will be
      credited at the rate of $4 per month.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are a participant in a defined benefit plan or a money purchase
      plan, you must receive written notice of a significant reduction the rate
      of future benefit accruals after the plan amendment is adopted and at
      least 15 days before the effective date of the plan amendment. The written
      notice must describe the plan amendment and its effective date.
    </p>

    <p>
      The 2001 Tax Relief Act put teeth in this rule by imposing a penalty
      excise for a plan's failure to provide notice to participants (or QDRO
      recipients) of plan amendments making a significant reduction in the rate
      of future benefit accrual. The penalty generally is imposed on the
      employer and applies after June 6, 2001. "Egregious" (for example,
      intentional) failure to give notice can in effect void the amendment. The
      toughened provision was prompted by widespread conversions of regular
      defined benefit pension plans to cash balance plans.

    </h3>

    <p>
      A break in service can have serious consequences for your pension if it
      extends for a long enough time and your pension benefit is not yet fully
      vested. However, ERISA does not permit your accrued benefit to be
      forfeited if you have a short break in service. ERISA in general
      guarantees that your service credit cannot be forfeited for absences
      shorter than five consecutive years.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="tip">
      <p>
        If you need to take a leave of absence, you should carefully examine
        your plan's rules so that you do not lose pension benefits you have
        accrued.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      If you continue to work past normal retirement age without retiring, you
      continue to accrue benefits, regardless of age. However, a plan can limit
      the total number of years of service that will be taken into account for
      benefit accrual for anyone under the plan. If you retire and later go back
      to work with your employer, you must be allowed to continue to accrue
      additional benefits, subject to any such limit on total years of service
      credited under the plan.
    </p>

    <p>
      Plans that provide for the payment of early retirement benefits may
      suspend payment of those benefits if you are re-employed before reaching
      normal retirement age. However, if the plan suspends payment of benefits
      before normal retirement age, under circumstances that would not have
      permitted a suspension <strong>after</strong> normal retirement age and
      the plan pays an actuarially reduced early retirement benefit, the plan
      must actuarially recalculate your monthly payment when you later begin to
      again receive payments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Under certain circumstances (described below), your pension payments after
      you reach normal retirement age may be suspended if you return to work.
      For example, ERISA permits a multi-employer plan to suspend the payment of
      normal retirement benefits if you return to work in the same industry, the
      same trade, and the same geographical area covered by the plan as when
      benefits commenced.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before suspending benefit payments, the plan must notify you of the
      suspension during the first calendar month in which the plan withholds
      payments. The notification must give you the information on why benefit
      payments are suspended, a general summary and a copy of the plan's
      suspension of benefit provisions, a statement regarding the Department of
      Labor regulations, and information on how you can request a review of the
      decision to suspend benefit payments. If most of this information is
      contained in the plan's summary plan description, the notification may
      simply refer to the appropriate pages of the summary plan description.
    </p>

    <p>
      A plan that suspends benefit payments must tell you how you can request an
      advance determination of whether a particular type of reemployment would
      result in a suspension.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="tip">
      <p>
        If you are a retiree and are considering taking a job, write to the

      <a name="8"></a>What is Vesting and How does it Work?
    </h3>

    <p>
      Vesting refers to the amount of time you must work before earning a
      non-forfeitable right to your accrued benefit. When you are fully vested,
      your accrued benefit is yours, even if you leave the company before
      reaching retirement age.
    </p>

    <p>
      Generally, if you are employed when you reach your plan's normal
      retirement age (usually 65), you will be fully vested. You also must be
      permitted to earn a vested right to your accrued benefit through service
      as described below.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are always entitled to 100 percent vesting in your own contributions
      and salary reduction contributions and their investment earnings. However,
      if your employer contributes to your accrued benefit (as most do) you may
      be required to complete a certain number of years of service with the
      employer before the employer portion of your accrued benefit becomes
      vested. Thus, if you terminate employment before working for a long enough
      period with your employer, you may forfeit all or part of the accrued
      benefit provided by your employer.
    </p>

    <p>
      You must be permitted to earn vesting credit according to a vesting
      schedule that is at least as generous as prescribed in
      <a
        href="https://webapps.dol.gov/dolfaq/dolfaqBYsubtopic.asp?subtopicid=150&amp;topicid=4"
        >ERISA vesting</a
      >
      schedules. Plans may provide a different standard, as long it is more
      generous than these minimums.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="tip">
      <p>
        Check your summary plan description for a description of your employer's
        vesting schedule.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      With some exceptions, once you begin participating in a pension plan, all
      of your years of service with the employer after you reached age 18 must
      be taken into account to determine whether and to what extent your accrued
      benefits are vested. This includes service you earned before you began to
      participate in the plan and service you earned before the effective date
      of ERISA.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, ERISA does allow plans to disregard certain periods for purposes
      of determining an employee's vesting service.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="tip">
      <p>
        For further details on what periods of service may be disregarded, see
        your summary plan description or the plan document to find out what

    <blockquote class="tip">
      <p>
        When you receive a benefit statement, compare the amount of your accrued
        benefit with the amount or percentage of your vested benefit to
        determine its accuracy. If these items are not clear from your benefit
        statement, ask your plan administrator.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The plan administrator may send you a benefit statement each year. If not,
      you may request a copy.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="tip">
      <p>
        In order to keep track of your vesting service, you may want to keep
        records of your hire date, the date you began participating in the plan,
        and the dates of any leaves of absence that could affect your total
        service.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      If the plan's vesting schedule is changed after you have completed at
      least three years of service, you have the right to select the vesting
      schedule that existed prior to the change for the entire length of your
      service, rather than the new schedule.
    </p>

    <p>
      Plans are considered top-heavy if they are tax qualified and more than 60
      percent of the benefits accrue to certain owners and officers, otherwise
      known as key employees. This could, for example, occur in small companies
      that have frequent turnover of rank-and-file workers. In years in which a
      plan is top-heavy, you have the right to both faster vesting and minimum
      benefits, if you are not a key employee. The 2001 Tax Relief Act eased the
      top-heavy rules for 2002 and after. This could have the effect of
      increasing key employees' shares in the plan, and reducing others' shares.
    </p>

    <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="9"></a>When Will Your Benefits Be Paid?</h3>

    <p>
      ERISA provides specific rules governing when you may or must begin
      receiving your pension benefits. First, ERISA sets the latest date by
      which the plan must permit you to begin receiving your benefit. Under this
      rule, payment must begin by the 60th day after the end of the plan year in
      which the latest of the following events occur:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Your reaching of age 65 or, if earlier, the normal retirement age
        specified by your plan
      </li>
      <li>The end of 10th year after you began participation in the plan</li>
      <li>Your termination of service</li>
    </ol>

    <blockquote class="example">
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> Your plan must provide-at a minimum-that you
        will be entitled to begin to receive your benefit 60 days after the end
        of the plan year in which you reach age 65, if you began participation
        in the plan at least 10 years before that year.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Your plan may allow you to receive payment of your benefit earlier than
      required by the above rule (and many plans do, subject to rules described
      below). However, as long as the present value of your vested accrued
      benefit is greater than $5,000, the plan cannot force you to begin
      receiving your benefit before you reach the age that is generally
      considered normal retirement age (or age 62 if later) .
    </p>

    <p>
      If the present value of your vested accrued benefit under the plan is
      $5,000 or less, the plan may require you to receive your benefit when it
      first becomes distributable, such as when you terminate. Under the 2001
      Tax Relief Act, such amounts, if more than $1,000, are automatically
      rolled over to an IRA for your benefit, unless you decide otherwise. This
      rule becomes effective after implementing regulations are issued.
    </p>

    <p></p>
    <h2>How Early May Your Plan Allow You to Take Payments?</h2>
    <p></p>

    <p>
      ERISA provides rules governing the times at which a pension plan may
      permit you to receive benefits. As these limitations on "distribution
      events" for payment vary, depending on the type of pension plan, you
      should consult your summary plan description for the specific conditions
      under which you will be entitled to receive your benefits. After the event
      occurs that permits payment of your benefit, your plan may require some
      reasonable period of time during which to calculate your benefit and
      determine your payment schedule, or to value your account balance and to
      liquidate any investments in which your account is invested.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following are a few general rules about possible distribution events
      for which your plan may provide.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          If your plan is a defined benefit plan or a money purchase plan, it
          will set a normal retirement age, which is generally the time at which
          you will be eligible to begin receiving your vested accrued benefit.
          These types of plans may permit earlier payments, however, either by
          providing for early retirement benefits, for which the plan may set
          additional eligibility requirements, or by permitting benefits to be
          paid when you terminate employment, suffer a disability, or die.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If your plan is a 401(k) plan, it may permit you to take some or all
          of your vested accrued benefit when you terminate employment, retire,
          die, become disabled, reach age 59-1/2, or if you suffer a hardship.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If your plan is a profit-sharing plan or a stock bonus plan, your plan
          may permit you to receive your vested accrued benefit after you
          terminate employment, become disabled, die, reach a specific age, or
          after a specific number of years have elapsed.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Your plan's summary plan description should describe all of the rules
      applicable to any of the events that permit distributions.
    </p>

    <p></p>
    <h2>When Must You Take Payment?</h2>
    <p></p>

    <p>
      ERISA also sets a date by which you must begin to receive your benefits,
      regardless of your wishes or the plan's rules, if your plan is
      tax-qualified. This mandatory beginning date is generally April 1 of the
      calendar year following the calendar year in which you reach age 72. ERISA
      provides rules for determining how much of your accrued benefit you must
      then receive each year.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="note">
      <p>
        Unless you own more than 5 percent of the business, the plan can allow
        you to postpone taking money out of your retirement plan beyond age 72
        if you're still employed.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p></p>
    <h2>In What Form Will Your Benefits Be Paid?</h2>
    <p></p>

    <p>
      With some very important limits, your plan can dictate the forms in which
      you may receive your accrued benefit. The protections that ERISA provides
      about form of benefit payments vary again depending on whether you have a
      defined benefit plan, money purchase plan, or other kind of defined
      contribution plan.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are covered under a defined benefit plan or a money purchase plan,
      your benefit must be available in the form of a life annuity, which means
      you will receive equal periodic payments (e.g., monthly, quarterly, etc.)
      for the rest of your life. If you are married, your benefit must be
      available in the form of a qualified joint and survivor annuity. (That
      form of benefit payment is described in the next section on spousal rights
      to benefit payments.) It is also free to offer benefits in a lump sum, as
      an alternative, subject to the participant's or spouse's right to insist
      on an annuity.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="caution">
      <p>
        Be careful about choosing a lump sum payout instead of an annuity under
        a defined benefit plan. The lump sum can be calculated-legally-in an
        amount which is less than what pension advisers consider the present
        value of the annuity. Consult a professional before deciding.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      If you are covered under a defined contribution plan that is not a money
      purchase plan, the plan may choose to pay your benefits in a single lump
      sum payment, or in any other form it chooses. If it offers a life annuity
      option, however, and you choose that option, you and your spouse (if any)
      will be protected by being offered a life annuity or a joint and survivor
      annuity that satisfies the requirements of ERISA.

    <h3 class="cellcolor">
      <a name="10"></a>What Will Your Surviving Spouse Get When You Die?
    </h3>

    <p>
      ERISA provides some guarantees for surviving spouses of deceased
      participants who had earned a vested pension benefit before death. The
      nature of the guaranteed interest depends on the type of plan and whether
      the participant dies before or after the annuity starting date-i.e.,
      before or after payment of the pension benefit is scheduled to begin.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="tip">
      <p>
        The rules we discuss apply to participants who completed an hour of
        service (or paid leave) on or after August 23, 1984. ERISA's survivor
        annuity rules are different if you are the surviving spouse of a
        participant who left employment before that date.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      In the case of a defined benefit plan (traditional pension plan) or a
      money purchase plan, the plan must provide for a qualified joint and
      survivor annuity. In the case of a defined contribution plan (a 401(k)
      plan or profit-sharing plan), the protections are somewhat different.
      Let's take a look at each of these.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="tip">
      <p>
        The summary plan description will tell you the type of plan involved and
        whether survivor annuities or other death benefits are provided under
        the plan.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p></p>
    <h2>What is a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity (QJSA)?</h2>
    <p></p>

    <p>
      The QJSA requirement applies to defined benefit plans and money purchase
      plans. ERISA says the retirement benefit payment must be paid in a series
      of equal, periodic payments over your lifetime, with a payment continuing
      to your spouse for life if you die first-unless you and your spouse have
      chosen otherwise. The periodic payment to your surviving spouse must be at
      least 50 percent and not more than 100 percent of the periodic payment
      received during your joint lives.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the plan provides other forms of benefit payment, and you and your
      spouse want to waive your rights to receive the QJSA and select one of the
      other payment forms, you can do so as long as:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>You and your spouse receive a timely explanation of the QJSA,</li>
      <li>Your waiver is made in writing within certain time limits, and</li>
      <li>
        Your spouse consents to the waiver in writing, as witnessed by a notary
        or plan representative.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p></p>
    <h2>What is a Qualified Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity (QPSA)?</h2>
    <p></p>

    <p>
      A survivor annuity must also be offered by a defined benefit or money
      purchase plan if a married participant with a vested benefit dies before
      he or she begins receiving benefits. This survivor annuity is called a
      qualified preretirement survivor annuity (QPSA), and ERISA specifies how
      the QPSA is calculated. You and your spouse must be given a timely
      explanation of the QPSA. You may only waive the right to a QPSA in
      writing, and your spouse must consent to the waiver of the QPSA in
      writing, witnessed by a notary or plan representative.
    </p>

    <p></p>
    <h2>
      What Survivor Benefit Rules Apply to Defined Contribution Plans (such as
      401(k) Plans)?
    </h2>
    <p></p>

    <p>
      Most profit sharing and stock bonus plans, e.g., 401(k) plans, generally
      need not offer a survivor annuity. However, there are different rules for
      such plans that protect the spouse as beneficiary.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before you begin to receive your benefits under such a plan your spouse is
      automatically presumed to be your beneficiary. Thus, if you die before you
      receive your benefits, all of your benefits will automatically go to your
      surviving spouse. If you wish to select a beneficiary other than your
      spouse, your spouse must consent in writing, witnessed by a notary or plan
      representative. This protects your spouse in the event of your death
      before any payout has been made.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, when it is time for you to take payouts from the plan (e.g., you
      terminate employment or reach retirement,) you may choose-without your
      spouse's consent-among any optional forms of payment offered by the plan,
      including a life annuity. If you choose a life annuity, however, your
      spouse is then protected by QJSA rules, and the benefit will be paid as a
      QJSA unless you and your spouse consent to a different form, as outlined
      above.

      <a name="11"></a>How Do You Make a Claim for Benefits?
    </h3>

    <p>
      Under ERISA you have a right to make a claim for benefits due under a
      plan. ERISA requires all plans to have a reasonable written procedure for
      processing your claims for benefits and for appealing if your claim is
      denied. The summary plan description should contain a description of your
      plan's procedures.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="tip">
      <p>
        If you believe you are entitled to a benefit from a pension plan, but
        your plan fails to set up a claims procedure, present the claim to the
        plan administrator.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      If you make a claim for benefits that is denied, the plan must notify you
      in writing, generally within 90 days after receipt of the claim, of the
      reasons for the denial and the specific plan provisions on which the
      denial is based. If the plan denies your claim because the administrator
      needs more information to make a decision, the administrator must tell you
      what information is needed. Any notice of denial must also tell you how to
      file an appeal.
    </p>

    <p>
      If special circumstances require your plan to take more time to examine
      your request, it must tell you within the 90 days that additional time is
      needed, why it is needed, and the date by which the plan expects to make a
      final decision. If you receive no answer at all in 90 days, this is
      treated the same as a denial, and you can appeal.
    </p>

    <p>
      You must be allowed at least 60 days to appeal any denial. After receiving
      your appeal, the plan generally must issue a ruling within 60 days, unless
      the plan provides for a special hearing. If the plan notifies you that it
      must hold a hearing, or that it has other special circumstances, it may
      have an additional 60 days.
    </p>

    <p>
      The plan must furnish you with a final decision on your appeal and the
      reasons for the decision with references to the relevant plan documents.
      If you disagree with the final decision, you may then file a lawsuit
      seeking your benefit under ERISA, as explained below. But courts generally
      require that you complete all the steps available to you under the claims
      procedure in a timely manner before you seek relief through a lawsuit.
      This is called "exhausting your administrative remedies."

      <a name="12"></a>Can You Choose Your Own Investments?
    </h3>

    <p>
      In certain defined contribution plans, instead of one group or individual
      making all the investment decisions for the plan's assets, plan officials
      provide a number of investment options, and ask you to decide how to
      invest your account balance by choosing among those options.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Department of Labor has rules about plans that permit you to direct
      your own investments. Under these rules, only if you truly exercise
      independent control in making your investment choices will plan officials
      be excused from fiduciary responsibility for your investment decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
      A plan in which you actually exercise independent control over the
      investment of your individual account is called a 404(c) plan (after
      section 404(c) of ERISA). If you are a participant in a 404(c) plan, you
      are responsible for the consequences of your investment decision, and you
      cannot sue the plan officials for investment losses that result from your
      decision.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are entitled to receive a broad range of information about the
      investment choices available under a 404(c) plan.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="tip">

        A plan that intends to relieve plan officials of fiduciary duties over
        investments must inform you of that fact.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      A 404(c) plan must give you sufficient information about investment
      options for you to be able to make informed decisions. The information you
      are entitled to receive without asking includes the following:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Notice that the plan officials may be relieved of liability of losses.
      </li>
      <li>
        A description of each investment option, including the investment goals,
        risk and return characteristics.
      </li>
      <li>Information about designated investment managers.</li>
      <li>
        An explanation of when and how to make investment instructions and any
        restrictions on when you can change investments.
      </li>
      <li>
        A statement of the fees that may be charged to your account when you
        change investment options or buy and sell investments.
      </li>
      <li>
        Information about your shareholder voting rights and the manner in which
        confidentiality will be provided on how you vote your shares of stock.
      </li>
      <li>
        The name, address, and phone number of the plan fiduciary or other
        person designated to provide certain additional information on request.

      <li>
        For security investors, a copy of the most recent prospectus for the
        security.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Effective starting in 2007, a plan may arrange to provide individual
      investment advice, without liability for plan officials, subject to strict
      conditions.

    <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="13"></a>How Must Your Plan Be Funded?</h3>

    <p>
      ERISA sets minimum funding rules to make sure sufficient money is
      available to pay promised pension benefits to you when you retire. Funding
      rules establish the minimum amounts that employers must contribute to
      plans to ensure that plans have enough money to pay benefits when due. The
      minimum funding rules apply to defined benefit plans and money purchase
      plans.
    </p>

    <p>
      Defined benefit plans generally fund future benefits over time. The plans
      consider probable investment gains and losses and make assumptions about
      factors such as future interest rates and potential workforce changes.
      ERISA provides detailed funding rules to protect you from financing
      methods that could prove inadequate to pay the promised benefits when they
      are due.
    </p>

    <p>
      ERISA provides severe sanctions against an employer who fails to meet the
      funding obligations. Any employer who fails to comply with the minimum
      funding requirements is charged an excise tax on the amount of the
      accumulated funding deficiency, unless the employer receives a waiver of
      the minimum funding requirements. This tax is imposed whether the
      under-funding was accidental or intentional.
    </p>

    <p>
      Certain actions can also be taken by the Department of Labor and the
      Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to enforce the minimum funding
      standards.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="tip">

        December 8, 1994.

    <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="14"></a>Can Your Plan Be Terminated?</h3>

    <p>
      Although pension plans must be established with the intention of being
      continued indefinitely, employers are allowed to terminate plans.
    </p>

    <p>
      If your plan terminates or becomes insolvent, ERISA provides you some
      protection. In a tax-qualified plan, your accrued benefit must become 100
      percent vested as soon as the plan terminates, to the extent then funded.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a partial termination occurs, for example, if your employer closes a
      particular plant or division that results in the layoff of a substantial
      portion of plan participants, immediate 100 percent vesting, to the extent
      funded, also is required for affected employees.
    </p>

    <p></p>
    <h2>
      What If Your Plan Terminates Without Enough Money to Pay the Benefits?
    </h2>
    <p></p>

    <p>
      If your terminated plan is a defined benefit plan insured by the Pension
      Benefit Guaranty Corporation, PBGC will guarantee the payment of your
      vested pension benefits up to the limits set by law. Benefits that are not
      guaranteed or that exceed PBGC's limits may be paid, depending on the
      plan's funding and on whether PBGC is able to recover additional amounts
      from the employer.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="tip">
      <p>
        If a plan terminates, and the plan purchases annuity contracts from an
        insurance company to pay pension benefits in the future, plan
        fiduciaries must take certain steps to select the safest available
        annuity. Thus, in accordance with Department of Labor guidance, the plan
        must conduct a thorough search with respect to the financial soundness
        of insurance companies that provide annuities, to better assure the
        future payment of benefits to participants and beneficiaries.

      Your employer may choose to merge your plan with another plan. If your
      plan is terminated as a result of the merger, the benefit you would be
      entitled to receive after the merger must be at least equal to the benefit
      you were entitled to receive before the merger.

    <h2>Can You Be Fired for Suing for Making a Claim Under ERISA?</h2>
    <p></p>

    <p>
      ERISA prohibits employers from promising pensions and then firing or
      disciplining workers to avoid paying a pension. To that end, ERISA says it
      is unlawful for an employer to discharge, fine, suspend, expel,
      discipline, or discriminate against you or any beneficiary for the purpose
      of interfering with the attainment of any right to which you may become
      entitled under the plan or the law.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, employers cannot take any of these steps against you for exercising
      your rights under a plan or under ERISA, or for giving information or
      testimony in any inquiry or proceeding relating to ERISA. Further, the use
      of force or violence to restrain, coerce, or intimidate you for the
      purpose of interfering with your rights or prospective rights is
      punishable by a fine of up to $10,000 and/or up to one year in prison.

    <h2>
      Can Your Creditors Get to Your Pension if You Get into Financial Trouble?
    </h2>
    <p></p>

    <p>
      In general, your pension benefits cannot be taken away from you by people
      to whom you owe money. However, the IRS can attach such benefits for tax
      claims. And the law makes a limited further exception when family support
      is at stake. Thus, a state court can transfer some of your pension benefit
      by issuing a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO), and the plan must
      honor the order.
    </p>

    <p></p>
    <h2>What Is a QDRO?</h2>
    <p></p>

    <p>
      Before a plan honors a domestic relations order awarding part or all of
      your pension benefit to your spouse, former spouse, child or other
      dependent, the plan must determine whether the order is a qualified
      domestic relations order (QDRO.) The order must meet these requirements:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        It must relate to child support, alimony, or marital property rights
      </li>
      <li>It must be made under state domestic relations law.</li>
      <li>
        It should clearly specify your name and last known mailing address and
        the name and last known address of each alternate payee. (The alternate
        payee is the spouse, ex-spouse, or dependent to whom the benefits are
        awarded.)
      </li>
      <li>
        It must state the name of your plan; the amount or percentage - or the
        method of determining the amount or percentage - of the benefit to be
        paid to the alternate payee; and the number of payments or time period
        to which the order applies.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      It cannot provide a type or form of benefit that is not provided under the
      plan, and it cannot require the plan to provide an actuarially increased
      benefit.
    </p>

    <p>
      If an earlier QDRO applies to your benefit, the earlier QDRO takes
      precedence over a later one.
    </p>

    <p>
      In certain situations, a QDRO may provide that payment is to be made to an
      alternate payee before you are entitled to receive your benefit. For
      example, if you are still employed, a QDRO could require payment to an
      alternate payee to begin on or after your "earliest retirement age,"
      whether or not the plan would allow you to receive benefits at that time.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="tip">
      <p>
        If you are in the process of a divorce, and a QDRO is being prepared for
        your family, be sure that the QDRO addresses (1) whether a benefit is
        payable to an alternate payee on your death and (2) the consequences of
        the death of the alternate payee.
      </p>

    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Federal, state, or local government plans, including plans of certain
        international organizations
      </li>
      <li>Certain church or church association plans</li>
      <li>
        Plans maintained solely to comply with state workers' compensation,

      <li>
        Plans maintained outside the United States primarily for non-resident
        aliens
      </li>
      <li>
        Unfunded excess benefit plans-plans maintained solely to provide
        benefits or contributions in excess of those allowed for tax-qualified
        plans
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The Labor Department's Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration is the
      agency charged with enforcing the rules governing the conduct of plan
      managers, investment of plan assets, reporting and disclosure of plan
      information, enforcement of the fiduciary provisions of the law, and
      workers' benefit rights.

    <p>Other federal agencies that regulate plans include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The Internal Revenue Service is responsible for ensuring compliance
          with the Internal Revenue Code, which establishes the rules for
          operating a tax-qualified pension plan, including pension plan funding
          and vesting requirements. A pension plan that is tax-qualified can
          offer special tax benefits both to the employer sponsoring the plan
