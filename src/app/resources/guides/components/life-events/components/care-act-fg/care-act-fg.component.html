<p>
  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, in concert with the
  enactment of the Health Care and Education Tax Credits Reconciliation Act of
  2010, resulted in a number of changes to the US tax code. As such there are a
  number of tax implications for individuals and businesses.
</p>

<h3>Individuals</h3>

<p><strong>Healthcare Exchanges</strong></p>

<p>
  Healthcare Exchanges, which are also referred to as Health Insurance
  Marketplaces, officially opened for enrollment in October 2013. Some of these
  exchanges are run by the state in which you reside. Others are run by the
  federal government.
</p>

<p>
  Individuals (including self-employed) who do not currently have insurance or
  buy insurance on their own can use these marketplaces to buy insurance, which
  becomes effective January 1 of each year. When you get health insurance
  through the Marketplace, you may be able to get the new advance Premium Tax
  Credit that will immediately help lower your monthly premium.
</p>

<p><strong>Individual Mandate</strong></p>

<p>
  Starting in 2019, the individual mandate is eliminated; however, for 2018, the
  penalty remained the same as it was in 2017 - $695 per person ($347.50 per
  child under 18) for the year or 2.5 percent of yearly household income (again,
  whichever is higher). The maximum penalty per family using this method is
  $2,085.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Background.</strong> Under the Affordable Care Act and for tax years
  2014 - 2018, United States citizens and legal residents were mandated to
  either obtain minimum essential health care coverage for themselves and their
  dependents, have an exemption from coverage, or make a payment when filing a
  tax return. The Individual Mandate is also known as the Individual Shared
  Responsibility Payment. Only the amount of income above the tax filing
  threshold ($10,000 indexed for inflation) for an individual, was used to
  calculate the penalty.
</p>

<p></p>
<blockquote class="caution">
  In 2021, five states - California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island,
  and Vermont - and the District of Columbia still have their own individual
  mandates.
  <p></p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Most people already have qualifying health care coverage and do not need to do
  anything more than maintain that coverage throughout the year. Self-insured
  ERISA policies used by larger employers, as well as Medicare, Medicaid, and
  CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program), and all of the health insurance
  plans offered by the exchanges fall under the category of minimum essential
  health care coverage.
</p>

<p></p>
<blockquote class="note">
  Certain individuals are exempt from the tax and include: (1) people with
  religious objections; (2) American Indians with coverage through the Indian
  Health Service; (3) undocumented immigrants; (4) those without coverage for
  less than three months; (5) those serving prison sentences; (6) those for whom
  the lowest-cost plan option exceeds 8 percent of annual income; and (7) those
  with incomes below the tax filing threshold who do not file a tax return.
</blockquote>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Refundable Tax Credit</strong></p>

<p>
  Effective in 2014, certain taxpayers are able to use a refundable tax credit
  to offset the cost of health insurance premiums so that their insurance
  premium payments do not exceed a specific percentage of their income.
  Qualified individuals are those with incomes between 133 percent and 400
  percent of the federal poverty level. A sliding scale based on family size is
  used to determine the amount of the credit. In addition, married taxpayers
  must file joint returns to qualify.
</p>

<p><strong>FSA Contributions</strong></p>

<p>
  FSA (Flexible Spending Arrangements) contributions are limited to $2,500 per
  year starting in 2013 and indexed for inflation after that. For 2022, the
  limit is $2,850 (up from $2,750 in 2021).
</p>

<p><strong>Rules for HSAs and Archer MSAs</strong></p>

<p>
  Tax on non-qualified distributions from HSAs and Archer MSAs that are used to
  cover the cost of over the counter medicine without a script increased to 20
  percent starting in 2011. Medical devices, eyeglasses, contact lenses, copays,
  and deductibles are not affected, nor is Insulin even if it is
  non-prescription.
</p>

<p><strong>Medicare Part D</strong></p>

<p>
  The subsidy for the Medicare Part D tax deduction for employer-provided
  retirement prescription drug coverage was eliminated starting in 2013.
</p>

<p><strong>AGI Limits for Deductible Medical Expenses</strong></p>

<p>
  The deduction threshold of 7.5 percent of AGI for all taxpayers (Tax Cuts and
  Jobs Act of 2017) was made permanent by the pandemic tax relief package signed
  into law on December 27, 2020.
</p>

<p><strong>Health Coverage of Older Children</strong></p>

<p>
  The cost of employer-provided health care coverage for children (through age
  26) on tax returns is excluded from gross income.
</p>

<p><strong>Medicare Tax Increases for High Income Earners</strong></p>

<p>
  Starting in 2013, there is an additional 0.9 percent Medicare tax on wages
  above $200,000 for individuals ($250,000 married filing jointly). These
  amounts are not indexed to inflation.
</p>

<p>
  Also starting in 2013, there is a new Medicare tax of 3.8 percent on
  investment (unearned) income for single taxpayers with modified adjusted gross
  income (MAGI) over $200,000 ($250,000 joint filers). Investment income
  includes dividends, interest, rents, royalties, gains from the disposition of
  property, and certain passive activity income. Estates, trusts, and
  self-employed individuals are all liable for the new tax.
</p>

<p>
  Exemptions are available for business owners and income from certain
  retirement accounts, such as pensions, IRAs, 401(a), 403(b), and 457(b) plans,
  is exempt.
</p>

<h3>Businesses</h3>

<p><strong>Self-Employed </strong></p>

<p>
  If you run an income-generating business with no employees, then you're
  considered self-employed (not an employer) and can get coverage through the
  Marketplace and use it to find coverage that fits your needs. You are not
  considered an employer even if you hire independent contractors to do some
  work.
</p>

<p>
  If you currently have individual insurance, that is, a plan you bought
  yourself and not the kind you get through an employer, you may be able to
  change to a Marketplace plan. Furthermore, you can't be denied coverage or
  charged more because you have a preexisting health condition.
</p>

<p><strong>Small Businesses (50 or Fewer Employees) </strong></p>

<p>
  If you have 50 or fewer full-time equivalent (FTE) employees (generally,
  workers whose income you report on a W-2 at the end of the year) you are
  considered a small business under the health care law.
</p>

<p>
  As a small business, you may get insurance for yourself and your employees
  through the SHOP (Small Business Health Options Programs) Marketplace. This
  applies to non-profit organizations as well.
</p>

<p>
  And, if you have fewer than 25 employees, you may qualify for the Small
  Business Tax Credit (see next section). Non-profit organizations can get a
  smaller tax credit.
</p>

<p>
  As an employer, you must provide notification to your employees of coverage
  options available through the Marketplace and are required to provide this
  notice to all current employees and each new employee effective October 1st,
  2013, regardless of plan enrollment status or full or part-time employment.
  The Department of Labor has sample notices that employers can use to comply
  with this regulation. One notice is for employers who do not offer a health
  care plan and the second is for employers who offer a health care plan.
</p>

<p><strong>Small Business Health Care Tax Credit </strong></p>

<p>
  Small businesses and tax-exempt organizations that employ 25 or fewer,
  full-time equivalent workers with average incomes of $55,200 or less in 2020,
  and that pay at least half (50 percent) of the premiums for employee health
  insurance coverage are eligible for the Small Business Health Care Tax Credit.
</p>

<p>
  Starting in 2014, the tax credit is worth up to 50 percent of your
  contribution toward employees' premium costs (up to 35 percent for tax-exempt
  employers). The tax credit is highest for companies with fewer than 10
  employees who are paid an average of $28,700 or less in 2022 ($27,800 in
  2021). The smaller the business, the bigger the credit is. The credit is
  available only if you get coverage through the SHOP Marketplace.
</p>

  <strong
    >Additional Tax on Businesses Not Offering Minimum Essential
    Coverage</strong
  >
</p>

<p>
  Effective January 1, 2015, an additional tax is levied on businesses with 50
  or more full-time equivalent (FTE) employees that do not offer minimum
  essential coverage. This penalty is sometimes referred to as the Employer
  Shared Responsibility Payment or "Pay or Play" penalty.
</p>

<p>
  For tax years 2015 and after, an applicable large employer is liable for an
  Employer Shared Responsibility payment only if:
</p>

<p>
  (a) The employer does not offer health coverage or offers coverage to fewer
  than 95 percent of its full-time employees and the dependents of those
  employees and at least, one of those full-time employees receive a premium tax
  credit to help pay for coverage on a Marketplace;
</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>
  (b) The employer offers health coverage to all or at least 95 percent of its
  full-time employees but at least one full-time employee receives a premium tax
  credit to help pay for coverage on a Marketplace, which may occur because the
  employer did not offer coverage to that employee or because the coverage the
  employer offered that employee was either unaffordable to the employee or did
  not provide minimum value.
</p>

<p></p>
<blockquote class="note">
  Employers with fewer than 50 FTE (full-time equivalent) employees are
  considered small businesses and are exempt from the additional tax.
</blockquote>
<p></p>

<p>
  Employers that are subject to the employer shared responsibility provisions
  (Applicable Large Employers or ALEs) also have information reporting
  responsibilities regarding minimum essential coverage offered to employees.
  These responsibilities require employers to send reports to employees and to
  the IRS. Information reporting returns are to be filed and furnished in early
  2022 for 2021. An employer that sponsors self-insured health insurance
  coverage - whether or not the employer is an ALE - has insurer information
  reporting responsibilities as a provider of minimum essential coverage.
</p>

<p>
  The amount of the annual Employer Shared Responsibility Payment is based
  partly on whether you offer insurance.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If you don't offer insurance, the annual payment is $2,000 (indexed for
    inflation) per full-time employee (excluding the first 30 employees).
  </li>

  <li>
    For an employer that offers coverage to at least 95 percent of its full-time
    employees (and their dependents), but has one or more full-time employees
    who receive a premium tax credit, the payment is computed separately for
    each month. The amount of the payment for the month equals the number of
    full-time employees who receive a premium tax credit for that month
    multiplied by 1/12 of $4,120 in 2022. The amount of the payment for any
    calendar month is capped at the number of the employer's full-time employees
    for the month (minus up to 30) multiplied by 1/12 of $2,750 in 2022.
  </li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<blockquote class="note">
  Unlike employer contributions to employee premiums, the Employer Shared
  Responsibility Payment is not tax deductible. In addition, Employer Shared
  Responsibility payments (either $2,000 or $3,000) are indexed to inflation
  beginning in years after 2014. For 2022, these numbers are $2,750 and $4,120,
  respectively.
</blockquote>
<p></p>

<p>
  A health plan meets minimum value if it covers at least 60 percent of the
  total allowed costs of benefits provided under the plan. All plans in the
  Marketplace meet minimum value, so any coverage offered through the SHOP
  Marketplace should qualify.
</p>

<p><strong>Excise Tax on Indoor Tanning Services</strong></p>

<p>
  A 10 percent excise tax on indoor tanning services went into effect on July 1,
  2010. The tax doesn't apply to phototherapy services performed by a licensed
  medical professional on his or her premises. There's also an exception for
  certain physical fitness facilities that offer tanning as an incidental
  service to members without a separately identifiable fee.
</p>

<p><strong>Health Care Taxes Repealed</strong></p>

<p>
  Three healthcare-related taxes enacted to fund the Affordable Care Act - and
  that had previously been delayed or suspended - were repealed under the
  Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Medical device excise tax</li>
  <li>Annual fee on health insurance providers</li>
  <li>
    Excise tax on high cost employer-sponsored health coverage ("Cadillac tax")
  </li>
</ul>
