    With the costs of a college education rising every year, the keys to funding
    your child's education are to plan early and invest shrewdly. However, there
    are steps you can take if you get a late start. Moreover, there are a number
    of effective techniques for increasing financial aid opportunities and
    reducing taxes. Here are some guidelines for funding your child's education
    that are geared to parents whose children are no older than elementary
    school age.
  </p>

  <h2>Start Saving Early</h2>

  <p>
    College is expensive and proper planning can lessen the financial squeeze
    considerably - especially if you start when your child is young. Getting an
    early start on saving is basic to funding your child's education. The
    earlier you start, the more you'll benefit from the compounding of interest.
  </p>

  <p>
    According to the College Board, average published tuition and fees for
    full-time in-state students at public four-year colleges and universities
    increased 1.1 percent before adjusting for inflation, rising from $10,440 in
    2019-20 to $10,560, in 2020-21. Average published tuition and fees at
    private nonprofit four-year institutions increased 2.1 percent before
    adjusting for inflation, rising from $36,880 in 2019-20 to $37,650 in
    2020-21.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="Planning Aid">
    <p>
      <strong>Planning Aid:</strong> For an estimate of the amount of money you
      would have at the time your child enters college if you begin saving now,
      see the Financial Calculator:
      <a
        href="http://www.cpasitesolutions.com/content/calcs/index.php?id=11&amp;category=College"
        >College Savings Calculator</a
      >.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    When should you start saving? This depends on how much you think your
    children's education will cost. The best way is to start saving before they
    are born. The sooner you begin, the less money you will have to put away
    each year.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="example">
    <p>
      Suppose you have one child, age six months, and you estimate that you'll
      need $120,000 to finance his college education 18 years from now. If you
      start putting away money immediately, you'll need to save $3,500 per year
      for 18 years (assuming an after-tax return of seven percent). On the other
      hand, if you put off saving until the child is six years old, you'll have
      to save almost double that amount every year for twelve years.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Another advantage of starting early is that you'll have more flexibility
    when it comes to the type of investment you'll use. You'll be able to put at
    least part of your money in equities, which, although riskier in the
    short-run, are better able to outpace inflation than other investments after
    time.
  </p>

  <h2>Find Out How Much You'll Need To Save</h2>

  <p>
    How much will your child's education cost? It depends on whether your child
    attends a private or state school. According to the College Board, for the
    2020-21 school year the total expenses - tuition, fees, board, personal
    expenses, and books and supplies - for the average four-year private college
    are about $54,880 per year and about $26,820 per year for the average
    four-year in-state public college. However, these amounts are averages: the
    tuition, fees, and board for some private colleges can exceed $75,000 per
    year whereas the costs for a state school can often be kept under $10,000
    per year. It should also be noted that in 2020-21 the average amount of
    grant aid for a full-time undergraduate student was about $7,330 and $21,660
    for four-year public and private schools, respectively. More than 70 percent
    of full-time students receive grant aid to help pay for college.

  <h2>Choose Your Investments</h2>

  <p>
    As with any investment, you should choose those that will provide you with a
    good return and that meet your level of risk tolerance. The ones you choose
    should depend on when you start your savings plan-the mix of investments if
    you start when your child is a toddler should be different from those used
    if you start when your child is age 12.

    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The following are often recommended as investments suitable for education
    funds:
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Series EE Bonds</em> are extremely safe investments. For tax treatment
    of redemption proceeds used for college, please see the Financial Guide:
    <a
      href="?item=9&amp;cat=Higher Education Costs: How To Get The Best Tax Treatment"
      >HIGHER EDUCATION COSTS: How To Get The Best Tax Treatment.</a
    >
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>U.S. Government Bonds</em> are also safe investments that offer a
    relatively higher return. If you use zero-coupon bonds for your child's
    education, you can time the receipt of the proceeds to fall in the year when
    you need the money. A drawback of such bonds is that a sale before their
    maturity date could result in a loss on the investment. Further, the accrued
    interest is taxable even though you don't receive it until maturity.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>CDs</em> are safe, but usually provide a lower return than the rate of
    inflation. The interest is taxable.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Municipal Bonds</em>, if they are highly rated, can provide an
    acceptable return from the tax-free interest if you're in the higher income
    tax brackets. Zero-coupon municipals can be timed to fall due when you need
    the funds and are useful if you begin saving later in the child's life.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      Be sure to convert the tax-free return quoted by sellers of such bonds
      into an equivalent taxable return. Otherwise, the quoted return may be
      misleading. The formula for converting tax-free returns into taxable
      returns is as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      Divide the tax-free return by 1.00 minus your top tax rate to determine
      the taxable return equivalent. For example, if the return on municipal
      bonds is 5 percent and you are in the 30 percent tax bracket, the
      equivalent taxable return is 7.1 percent (5 percent divided by 70
      percent).
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    <em>Stocks</em> contained in an appropriate mutual fund or portfolio can
    provide you with a higher yield at an acceptable risk level. Stock mutual
    funds can provide superior returns over the long term. Income and balanced
    funds can meet the investment needs of those who begin saving when the child
    is older.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Deferred Annuities</em> provide you with tax deferral, but the yield may
    not be acceptable because of the relatively high cost of these investments.
    Further, amounts withdrawn before you reach age 59-1/2 may be subject to a
    10 percent premature withdrawal penalty.

  <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="2"></a>If You're Caught Short</h3>

  <p>
    If you have insufficient savings for your child's education when he or she
    is close to entering college, there are ways to generate additional funds
    both now and when your child is about to enter school:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        You can start saving as much as possible during the remaining years.
        However, unless your income level is high enough to support an extremely
        stringent savings plan, you will probably fall short of the amount you
        need.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        You can take on a part-time job. However, this will raise your income
        for purposes of determining whether you are eligible for certain types
        of student aid. In addition, your child may be able to take on part-time
        or summer jobs.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        You can tap your assets by taking out a home equity loan or a personal
        loan, selling assets or borrowing from a 401(k) plan.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      You (or your child) can apply for various types of student aid and
      education loans (discussed below and in Info Sources).
    </li>
  </ol>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      Sources of student aid and education loans should be exhausted before
      other types of loans are used, since the former make better sense
      financially. In some cases, however, a home equity loan can be
      advantageous because of the deductibility of interest.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="3"></a>Sources Of Financial Aid</h3>

  <p>
    Here is a summary of the possible sources of financial aid. The types of aid
    and tax implications change frequently, so consult your financial advisor
    for specifics when you're approaching the time to seek financial aid.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Grants,</em> the best type of financial aid because they do not have to
    be paid back, are amounts awarded by governments, schools, and other
    organizations. Some grants are need-based and others are not.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Federal Pell Grant Program. Pell grants are need-based.</li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      Don't assume that middle class families are ineligible for need-based aid
      or loans. The assessment of whether a family qualifies as "in need"
      depends on the cost of the college and the size of the family.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <ul>
    <li>
      State education departments may make grants available. Inquiries should be
      made of the state agency. Employers may provide subsidies.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      Private organizations may provide scholarships. Inquiries should be made
      at schools.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      Most schools provide aid and scholarships, both need-based and
      non-need-based.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      Military scholarships are available to those who enlist in the Reserves,
      National Guard, or Reserve Officers Training Corps. Inquiries should be
      made at the branch of service.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      Try negotiating with your preferred college for additional financial aid,
      especially if it offers less than a comparable college.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    <em>Loans</em> may be need-based, and others are not. Here is a summary of
    loans:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Stafford loans (formerly guaranteed student loans) are federally
      guaranteed and subsidized low-interest loans made by local lenders and the
      federal government. They are need-based for subsidized loans; however, an
      unsubsidized version is also available.
    </li>
    <li>
      Perkins loans are provided by the federal government and administered by
      schools. They are need-based. Inquiries should be made at school aid
      offices.
    </li>
    <li>
      Parent loans for undergraduate students (PLUS) and supplemental loans for
      students are federally guaranteed loans by local lenders to parents, not
      students. Inquiries should be made at college aid offices or by calling
      800-333-4636.
    </li>
    <li>
      Schools themselves may provide student loans. Inquiries should be made at
      the school.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <em>Work-Study Programs.</em> This is a program that is federally funded and
    based on the family's financial need. The student works on-campus and
    receives partly subsidized pay. The receipt of work-study funds does not
    affect the level of "need" for purposes of need-based grants and loans.
  </p>

  <p>
    To make a thorough investigation, you should fill out the financial aid
    application, which you can obtain from the school's financial aid office.
    You will have to provide tax returns. The amount you are determined to be
    eligible for depends on your income, the size of your family, the number of
    family members currently attending college, and your assets.

  <h2>How To Increase The Amount Of Financial Aid</h2>

  <p>
    Here are some strategies that may increase the amount of aid for which your
    family is eligible:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <em>Try to avoid putting assets in your child's name.</em> As a general
      rule, education funds should be kept in the parents' names, since
      investments in a child's name can impact negatively on aid eligibility.
      For example, the rules for determining financial aid decrease the amount
      of aid for which a child is eligible by 35 percent of assets
      <em>the child owns</em> and by 50 percent of <em>the child's income.</em>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <blockquote class="example">
    <p>
      If your child owns $1,000 worth of stock, the amount of aid for which he
      or she is eligible for is reduced by $350. On the other hand, the amount
      of aid is reduced by (effectively) only 5.6 percent of your assets and
      from 22 to 47 percent of your income.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <ol start="2">
    <li>
      <em>Reduce your income.</em> Income for financial aid purposes is
      generally determined based upon your previous year's income tax situation.
      Therefore, in the years immediately prior to and during college, try to
      reduce your taxable income. Some ways to do this include:
    </li>

    <ul>
      <li>Defer capital gains.</li>
      <li>Sell losing investments.</li>
      <li>
        Reduce the income from your business. If you are the owner of your own
        business, you may be able to reduce your taxable income by taking a
        lower salary, deferring bonuses, etc.
      </li>
      <li>Avoid distributions from retirement plans or IRAs in these years.</li>
      <li>
        Pay your federal and state taxes during the year in the form of
        estimated payments rather than waiting until April 15 of the following
        year.
      </li>
      <li>
        Since a portion of discretionary assets is included in the family's
        expected contribution from income, reduce discretionary assets by paying
        off credit cards and other consumer loans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take advantage of vehicles which defer income, such as 401(k) plans,
        other retirement plans or annuities.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Detail your financial hardships.</em> If you have any financial
        hardships, let the deciding authorities know (via the statement of
        financial need) exactly what they are, if they are not clear on the
        application. The financial aid officer may be able to assist you in
        explaining hardships.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <em>Have your child become independent (if feasible).</em> In this case,
      your income is not considered in determining how much aid your child will
      be eligible for. Students are considered independent if they:
    </li>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Are at least 24 years old by the end of the year for which they are
        applying for aid,
      </li>
      <li>Are veterans,</li>
      <li>Have dependents other than their spouse,</li>
      <li>Are wards of the court or both parents are deceased,</li>
      <li>Are graduate or professional students or</li>
      <li>
        Are married and are not claimed as dependents on their parents' returns.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ol>

  <!-- <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p> -->

  <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="5"></a>How To Reduce Taxes</h3>

  <p>
    As noted above, education funds should generally be kept in the parents'
    names because of financial-aid considerations. However, in specific cases,
    it may be better to keep the investments in your child's name since the tax
    rate on the income will be less than if they are held in your name.
    Professional advice should be sought in making this decision.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the past, parents would invest in the child's name in order to shift
    income to the lower-bracket child. However, the addition of the "kiddie tax"
    mostly put an end to that strategy. Now, investment income over $2,300 for
    2022 ($2,200 in 2021) of children under the age of 19 (or 24 if a full-time
    student) is taxed at the parents' rate. Once the child reaches age 19,
    however, all income is taxed at the child's rate. Of this $2,300, one-half
    probably won't be taxed due to the availability of the standard deduction
    while the other half would be taxed at the child's rate.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="note">
    <p>
      These rules apply to unearned income. If a child has earned income, this
      amount is always taxed at the child's rate. If you decide to invest in
      your child's name, here are some tax strategies to consider:
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <ol>
    <li>
      You can shift just enough assets to create $2,300 in taxable income to an
      under-19 child.
    </li>
    <li>
      You can buy U.S. Savings Bonds (in the child's name) scheduled to mature
      after your child reaches age 19.
    </li>
    <li>
      You can invest in equities that pay small dividends but have a lot of
      potential for appreciation. The income earned when your child is under the
      age of 19 will be minimal, and the growth in the stocks will occur over
      the long term.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you own a family business, you can employ your child in the business.
      Earned income is not subject to the "kiddie tax," and is deductible by the
      business if the child is performing a legitimate function. Additionally,
      if your business is a sole proprietorship and your child is under the age
      of 19, then he or she will not pay social security taxes on the income.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <blockquote class="note">
    <p>
      The Kiddie Tax does not apply if the earned income of a student over age
      18 exceeds half of the child's living expenses. Living expenses include
      food, housing, clothing, medical, dental, education and other necessary
      costs of support. Students over 18 are considered independent from their
      parents if they provide more than 50 percent of their own support.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    There are also a number of tax incentives that you might be able to take
    advantage of. Please see the Financial Guide:
    <a
      href="?item=9&amp;cat=Higher Education Costs: How To Get The Best Tax Treatment"
      >HIGHER EDUCATION COSTS: How To Get The Best Tax Treatment</a
    >.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      Reporting the kiddie tax on the child's return using the required Form
      8615, <em>Tax for Certain Children Who Have Unearned Income, </em> calls
      for showing the parents' taxable income. A parent reluctant to show that
      item to a teenager may instead report the child's investment income of the
      parent's return, on Form 8814,
      <em>Parent's Election to Report Child's Interest and Dividends, </em>. But
      this is not allowed, and the Form 8615 route must be followed, where the
      child has taxable earned income, as many teenagers would.
