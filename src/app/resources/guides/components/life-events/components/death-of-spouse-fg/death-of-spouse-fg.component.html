  <p>
    Coping with the death of a spouse is difficult at best, but unfortunately,
    many decisions need to be made and actions must be taken in the first few
    months after the death occurs. This Financial Guide provides information
    that will help guide you through this difficult time.
  </p>

  <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="1"></a>Collecting the Papers</h3>

  <p>
    The first step is to collect the necessary paperwork so that you can
    finalize the estate and file for any benefits that you and your children are
    entitled to.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>The Death Certificate</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    Many of the offices or agencies you contact will require you to provide a
    copy of the death certificate. You can buy certified copies of the death
    certificate through your funeral director or directly from the county health
    department for a small fee, typically a few dollars per certificate. It is
    worth paying the money for the certified copies, however, since many
    companies require it.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      Whether you think you need them or not, try to get at least 10 certified
      copies of the death certificate.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Insurance Policies</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    You will probably find copies of life, health, home mortgage, accident, and
    other insurance policies in a safe deposit box or with your spouse's
    personal belongings. Any or all of these insurance policies could be sources
    of possible benefits to you and your children.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Social Security Numbers</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    You'll need the Social Security numbers of your spouse and any dependent
    children.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      Your spouse's Social Security number can be found on the death
      certificate.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Military Discharge Papers</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    You will need a copy of a certificate of honorable (or other than
    dishonorable) discharge if your spouse was a veteran. If you cannot find a
    copy of the discharge, write to:
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <blockquote>
    <address>
      The Department of Defense<br />National Personnel Record Center<br />9700
      Page Avenue<br />St. Louis, MO 63138<br />(314) 801-0800<br />website:
      <a href="http://www.archives.gov">www.archives.gov</a>
    </address>
  </blockquote>
  <p></p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Marriage Certificate</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    If you are going to apply for benefits based on your marital relationship,
    you will need copies of your marriage certificate. Copies are available at
    the office of the County Clerk where the marriage license was issued.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Children's Birth Certificates</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    You will need copies of birth certificates for dependent children. Copies
    are available at either the state or county public health offices where the
    child was born.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>The Will</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    You will need a copy of the will. Your spouse's lawyer may have the will, or
    it may be in a safe, a safe deposit box, or with your spouse's personal
    belongings.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>List of Assets</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    A complete list of all of your spouse's property, including real estate,
    stocks, bonds, savings accounts, and personal property will be needed. Land
    titles, stocks certificates, and other financial papers may be stored in a
    safe deposit box or another secure place.
  </p>

  <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="2"></a>Survivor Benefits</h3>

  <p>
    The next step is to determine whether you are eligible for any benefits.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Insurance</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    Contact any insurers that may have issued policies to your spouse. Your
    spouse may have had several types of insurance policies, including the
    following:<br />
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Life insurance,</li>
    <li>Mortgage or loan insurance,</li>
    <li>Accident insurance,</li>
    <li>Auto insurance,</li>
    <li>Credit card insurance, and</li>
    <li>Various types of insurance provided by your spouse's employer.</li>
  </ul>
  <br />

  <p>
    The proceeds from an insurance policy can generally be paid directly to the
    named beneficiary. These claims can be processed quickly and are an
    important source of income for the survivors during this difficult time.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      File claims for insurance policies as soon as possible, especially if
      finances are a concern.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    You may be required to decide how you want the payments made. Options might
    include taking the money in a lump sum or having the insurance company make
    fixed payments over a period of time. Which payment option to choose depends
    on your financial situation. You may, for example, want smaller fixed
    payments in order to have a steady income. Or you may want the full amount
    immediately to pay bills or to invest.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is highly recommended that you consult with a financial advisor about
    this decision. Do not succumb to pressure from an insurer to accept one plan
    or another. Take your time and make the right decision for you and your
    family.
  </p>

  <h2>Social Security</h2>

  <p>
    Your spouse is considered covered by Social Security if he or she paid into
    Social Security for at least 40 quarters. If you're not sure or need more
    information, contact your local Social Security Administration office or
    call 800-772-1213 to determine if he or she was eligible. To find the
    location of your local Social Security Office, visit the
    <a href="https://secure.ssa.gov/apps6z/FOLO/fo001.jsp">
      Social Security Administration Office Locator.</a
    >
  </p>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      If the deceased was already receiving benefits, do not deposit any checks
      received after death before checking with Social Security.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    If your spouse was eligible, there are two additional types of possible
    benefits: (1) a death benefit and (2) survivor's benefits.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>One-Time Death Benefit</strong>. Social Security pays a one-time
      death benefit toward burial expenses. Complete the necessary form at your
      local Social Security office or ask the funeral director to complete the
      application and apply the payment directly to the funeral bill. This
      payment is made only to eligible spouses or to a child entitled to
      survivor's benefits.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Survivor's Benefits for a Spouse or Children</strong>. If you are
      age 60 or older, you may be eligible for survivor's benefits. The amount
      of any benefits for which you will be eligible before age 65 will be less
      than any benefits due at age 65 or over. If you are under age 60, you may
      also be eligible for benefits if you are a disabled widow, age 50 or older
      and you care for dependent children under age 16 or disabled children.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote class="note">
    <p>
      Children who are under age 18 or are disabled may also be entitled to
      benefits.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      When applying for Social Security benefits, have available your spouse's
      birth and death certificates, your marriage certificate, birth
      certificates of any dependent children, Social Security numbers, and
      copies of your spouse's most recent federal income tax return.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <!-- <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p> -->

  <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="3"></a>Veterans' Benefits</h3>

  <p>
    If your spouse was a veteran who received a discharge other than
    dishonorable, you may be eligible to receive a non-service-related death
    benefit. For non-service-related deaths on or after October 1, 2019, VA will
    pay a $300 burial allowance (if not hospitalized by the VA at the time of
    death) and $796 for a plot. If the death happened while the Veteran was in a
    VA hospital or under VA contracted nursing home care, some or all of the
    costs for transporting the Veteran's remains may be reimbursed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Burial in a
    <a href="http://www.cem.va.gov/cems/listcem.asp">national cemetery</a> is
    free to a veteran, his or her spouse, and dependent children. Veterans are
    also eligible for a headstone or grave marker at no charge. The funeral
    director can help you apply for these benefits or you can contact the
    regional Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) office.
  </p>

  <p>
    If your spouse was receiving disability benefits, you and any dependent
    children may also be entitled to monthly payments. Check with your regional
    VA office.
  </p>

  <!-- <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p> -->

  <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="4"></a>Employee Benefits</h3>

  <p>
    If your spouse was employed at the time of death, ask his or her employer
    about any survivors' benefits. Your spouse may also be owed a paycheck for
    vacation or sick leave. If the employer-provided life, health, or accident
    insurance, you may be entitled to receive payments under these policies. If
    your spouse belonged to a union or professional organization, find out if
    this organization offers death benefits for members. If the death was
    work-related, you may be entitled to worker's compensation benefits.
  </p>

  <p>
    You should also contact all past employers, including federal, state, or
    local governments, to determine whether you are entitled to any payments
    from a pension plan.
  </p>

  <p>
    If your spouse was already retired and was receiving a pension, check with
    the employer to determine if you will continue to receive a pension payment,
    and in what amount. You should get professional guidance as to when and how
    to take any retirement plan distributions due your spouse or you.
  </p>

  </blockquote>

  <!-- <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p> -->

  <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="5"></a>The Will</h3>

  <p>
    If your spouse had a valid will, try to find a copy of it. Check with your
    lawyer, family and anyone who might know where the will is kept. It may be
    stored in a safe deposit box, which is sealed at the time of death in some
    states.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="caution">
    <p>Wills should not be stored in safe deposit boxes.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    If your spouse did not have a will, his or her estate will be distributed
    according to state intestacy law. However, the state intestacy law will not
    apply to property where the title is in the name of the deceased and another
    person who has a right of survivorship. This property automatically passes
    to the co-owner.
  </p>

  <!-- <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p> -->

  <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="6"></a>Probate</h3>

  <p>
    Probate is the legal process of paying the deceased's debts and distributing
    the estate to the rightful heirs. This process usually entails:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The appointment of an individual by the court to act as the personal
      representative or executor of the estate; this person is often named in
      the will. If there is no will, the court appoints a personal
      representative, usually the spouse.
    </li>
    <li>Proving that the will is valid.</li>
    <li>
      Informing creditors, heirs, and beneficiaries that the will is to be
      probated.
    </li>
    <li>
      Disposing of the estate by the personal representative in accordance with
      the will or state law.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The personal representative named in the will must file a petition with the
    court after the death. There is a fee for the probate process. Depending on
    the size and complexity of the probable assets, probating a will may require
    legal assistance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Assets jointly owned by the deceased and someone else are not subject to
    probate. Proceeds from a life insurance policy or Individual Retirement
    Account (IRA) that are paid directly to a beneficiary are also not subject
    to probate.
  </p>

  <!-- <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p> -->

  <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="7"></a>Taxes</h3>

  <p>There are various taxes that will have to be paid. Here is a summary:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Federal Estate Tax</strong>. Estate tax is generally only due on
      estates exceeding the unified credit exemption equivalent, which for 2022
      is $12,060,000 ($11,700,000 in 2021). Estates over the threshold amount
      are subject to 40 percent tax.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>State Death Taxes</strong>. State laws vary, but generally, any
      estate which pays a federal estate tax must also file a state estate or
      death tax form and pay the state death tax. This amount is paid by the
      estate to the state in which the deceased lived.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>State Inheritance Taxes</strong>. Again, state requirements vary.
      Most states charge no inheritance tax.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Federal and State Income Taxes</strong>. The federal and state
      income taxes of the deceased are due for the year of death. The taxes are
      due on the normal filing date of the following year unless an extension is
      requested.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      Professional guidance is strongly recommended in preparing the tax returns
      because the filing rules are quite complicated, and many tax-saving
      opportunities might be overlooked by an unqualified preparer.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <!-- <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p> -->

  <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="8"></a>Changing Ownership or Title</h3>

  <p>
    You may need to transfer ownership or change the title of property owned or
    revise documents after a death. Here are some items that should be checked:
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Insurance Policies</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    If you hold any insurance policies, you may have to change beneficiaries.
    You may decide that you no longer need to have the same coverage if you do
    not have dependents, especially in the case of life insurance policies. Auto
    insurance and home insurance may also need revision.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your spouse may have medical insurance coverage through work. Under a
    federal law called COBRA, you and any dependent children may be entitled to
    continue under your spouse's work-related medical insurance plan for up to
    36 months, provided you pay the premiums. On the other hand, you may need to
    purchase your own medical.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      Check with the employer to see if you can continue with its group health
      insurance plan, which may be less expensive. Contact the company issuing
      the policy to make any changes or for more information.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Automobiles</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    The title of the car owned by your spouse may need to be changed. Contact
    your state's Department of Motor Vehicles.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Will</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    If your will provides for property to pass to your spouse, it should be
    updated. You may want to contact your estate planner for assistance.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="rfg">
    <p>
      <strong>Related Guide:</strong> Please see the Financial Guide:
      <a href="?item=73&amp;cat=Estate Planning: How To Get Started"
        >ESTATE PLANNING: How to Get Started.</a
      >
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Bank Accounts, Stocks, Bonds</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    If you had a joint bank account with your spouse, it will automatically pass
    to you. Check with the bank about changing the title and signature card on
    the account. To change stocks or bond titles, check with your stockbroker.
  </p>

  <p>
    If a bank account was held only in the name of your spouse, those assets
    will have to go through probate. An exception to this would be trust
    accounts.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Safe Deposit Box</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    In most states, if the box was rented only in the name of your spouse, it
    will require a court order to open the box. Only the will or any other
    materials pertaining to the death can be removed before the will has been
    probated.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Credit Cards</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    Credit cards held exclusively in the name of your spouse should be canceled.
    Any payments due on these credit cards should be paid by the estate.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your spouse may have used credit cards in both your names or used credit
    cards listed only in your name. If so, make the payments due on these cards
    to keep your own good credit rating. Notify the credit card companies that
    your spouse is deceased and that the card should list your name only. Some
    people, particularly widows, may experience difficulties in getting a new
    card if they do not have their own credit rating.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      When applying for a card, inform the lender about credit cards you shared
      with your spouse, even if your name was not listed.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p></p>
  <h2>General Finances</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    Debts owed by your spouse will be the responsibility of the estate and
    should be forwarded to the personal representative or executor who is
    settling the estate. However, you should pay debts that are jointly owed
    (particularly mortgage payments and utility or phone bills) in order to keep
    a good credit rating.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="caution">
    <p>
      Do not immediately make permanent significant financial decisions, such as
      selling your home, moving, or changing jobs. You will need some time to
      consider your situation before you can make these decisions responsibly.
      If at all possible, do not rush into a decision you might later regret.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
