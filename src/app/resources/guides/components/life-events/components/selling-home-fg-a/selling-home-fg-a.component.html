          Here are some tips for getting the best possible price for your home
          and making the process as smooth as possible. By putting some time
          into choosing a real estate agent, for instance, you can avoid wasting
          unnecessary time on the market due to an ineffective or haphazard
          sales strategy. Further, there are actions you can take to make your
          home more saleable.

          To find a good real estate agent, gather a list of names of candidates
          you will interview. You may want to consider recommendations from
          colleagues, friends, and professionals, as well as names listed on
          posted "for sale" signs, especially for houses that have been sold.
          Once you have at least three names, schedule a telephone or in-person
          interview with the agent. You may encounter some resistance; if you
          run into a broker who refuses to take the time to answer your
          questions, just move to the next one.

                times (due to the savings on commissions paid to a broker),
                selling your own home without a broker is often more difficult
                unless you have a buyer in mind.

        <p>Be sure to ask potential agents the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <em>What problems do you see in marketing our home?</em> (The
              broker should be honest about potential problems in selling the
              home and able to think creatively about solutions.)
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <em

                to help you implement your plan?</em
              >
              Listen carefully to the answer to find out whether the agent
              exhibits a willingness to think creatively in approaching whatever
              problems might exist with the selling process and whether he or
              she has a cooperative attitude.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <em
                >Will you include any ideas you have for selling the home in a

          <li>
            <p>
              <em>Where do you live?</em> (You want a broker who lives nearby,
              who knows the good and bad points about your area.)
            </p>

          <li>
            <p>
              <em>How much is your commission?</em> (The average commission is 6
              or 7 percent. Although brokers sometimes take a cut in their
              commissions during the negotiation process in order to move a sale
              along there is no point in trying to bargain down a broker's
              commission at this point.)
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <em>Do you have a list of comparable homes?</em> (Such a list is
              essential in helping you arrive at an asking price for your home.)

          The listing agreement is a contract between the homeowners and the
          agent. It states how much the agent will be paid and what services
          will be provided.
        </p>

        <p>
          An exclusive right-to-sell type of agreement gives the broker the
          exclusive right to sell your house for a limited period of time. Other
          types of listing agreements vary either the exclusivity or time period
          of the listing. No matter which of these agreements are signed, the
          listing agent gets 100 percent of the commission if he or she sells
          the house and part of the commission if another broker sells the
          house.

          There are various things you can do before and during the selling
          process to move it along and make it less onerous. A good real estate
          agent may suggest the following:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong
                >Make cosmetic improvements to get the house looking as good as
                possible.</strong
              >
              For instance, patch damaged plaster and drywall, repaint, and
              re-wallpaper. Spruce up the exterior by replacing broken shingles
              or shutters or doing some minor landscaping to give your home more
              "curb appeal".
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <strong
                >Increase your home's appeal to a wider range of potential
                buyers.</strong
              >
              Repair or replace any part of your home that's been modified that
              might not appeal to the general population.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <strong
                >Make your home cozy and inviting when potentials buyers come
                by.</strong
              >
              Make sure the interior and exterior are clean, neat, and well
              maintained. Have a fire burning in the fireplace, bake some
              cookies or an apple pie, or have a pot of coffee brewing. Put away
              toys and tools. Keep pets out of sight. Not everyone is as
              enamored of Fido as your family is. Try not to cook foods like
              fish with lingering odors.

              Here are some ideas for working with your broker to speed up the
              sale of your home.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Offer a warranty.</strong> Sometimes offering a warranty
              on the roof, electrical system or appliances can speed up a sale
              or smooth the negotiating process, particularly if it's causing
              buyers to balk at the asking price.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Create a home sale kit with your broker.</strong> A home
              sale kit consists of flyers that are distributed to potential home
              buyers and contain photos of your home's exterior, interior, and
              surroundings. The sales flyer should also list major selling
              points and include information about utility costs, taxes, and a
              floor plan.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Do not help the broker show the home.</strong> Allow the
              broker to do his or her job. Make yourself available for
              questions, but do not try to help sell to potential buyers who are
              looking at your home.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Offer a bonus to your broker.</strong> A bonus shouldn't
              be obvious to the buyer because the buyer will wonder if the house
              price has been bumped up to accommodate the real estate broker's
              bonus. Instead, offer the bonus in the form of an increased
              commission, say 3.5 percent instead of 3 percent.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Take it off the market and re-list it later.</strong> If
              your house has been on the market for a long time, it may be
              perceived as undesirable. Taking it off the market and re-listing
              it at a later time sometimes helps.

          Although it is the broker's job to do the actual negotiating, the
          homeowners should stay involved in the process. Here are some tips for
          negotiating with buyers, once they have made their first offer.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Find out as much as possible about the potential buyer. Try to find
            out, for example, whether the buyer needs to buy a home quickly or
            is in a position to take plenty of time to negotiate. This will help
            you to decide what type of negotiating stance to take. Knowing
            details about the buyer's family will help you point out how your
            home accommodates their needs. And, if you know that a buyer lives
            in an apartment and will need to buy appliances for their new home,
            then you can throw in deal sweeteners such as refrigerators, washer
            and dryers, and furnishings.
          </li>

          <li>
            On the flip side, try to reveal as little as possible about your own
            situation.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          One final piece of advice is to avoid being confrontational, which can
          kill a potential deal during the negotiation process. The offers you
          receive will likely be 10 to 15 percent below your asking price. Do
          not be offended by this or by any "low-balling" techniques engaged in
          by buyers. Be willing to make some concessions. Make counter-offers
          and try to bring the offer closer to your asking price. If you feel
          that an offer is unreasonable, however, you can always reject it
          outright and wait for another buyer.

          Once you have signed the contracts, it is time to start planning the
          move. The closing date, which is generally your moving date, will fall
          about two months after the contracts are signed.
        </p>

        <h2>Hiring A Moving Company</h2>

        <p>
          One thing you should do immediately after the contracts are signed
          even though your moving date may be months away is to begin calling
          moving companies. Try to get recommendations from friends or
          colleagues. Call a number of movers for estimates. You will have to
          provide them with the number of miles involved in the move and the
          approximate weight of your belongings. The mover will help you in
          making this estimate. Do not use a mover whose estimate seems too low.
          The services provided may be second-rate. You get what you pay for!
        </p>

        <p>
          Ask in advance about extra charges for heavy items, stairways, or
          pianos. Be aware that having the movers pack for you will increase
          your moving bill by about 30 percent. Also, you may pay a premium if
          you schedule your move during busy moving times, generally after the
          25th of the month or before the 2nd.

        <p>
          Right after you have scheduled your move, start taking care of the
          following items:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Start throwing away things you don't want to bring with you.</li>

          <li>
            Decide which items you are leaving behind for the new owners, and
            tag them appropriately.
          </li>

          <li>
            If your move is job-related, ask whether your employer will
            reimburse you for part of the cost. Save any receipts relating to
            the move, since part of the cost will be deductible.
          </li>

          <li>
            Start shopping for a new bank in your new neighborhood. Open a
            checking account once you have found one with competitive fees and
            convenient branches.
          </li>

          <li>
            Get a change of address kit from the post office, and start
            notifying everyone of your impending change. Note that you will need
            to follow any instructions given by credit card companies, banks,
            and other institutions that are affected by a change of address;
            sending them a change-of-address card will generally not be
            effective.
          </li>

          <li>Call the schools in the new area to enroll your children.</li>

          <li>
            Obtain enough packing supplies from your mover, and begin packing,
            unless the mover will be doing the packing for you.
          </li>

          <li>
            Get copies of your medical and dental records (and veterinary
            records), so you can hand these to your new doctors after you move.
          </li>

          <li>
            Be sure your move is covered by insurance: either the moving
            company's insurance or your homeowner's insurance. Call your
            insurance company to determine whether the move is covered. Also,
            take care of transferring your homeowner's insurance to the new
            home.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Then, as you get closer to the date of your move, take care of the
          following:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Call the utility companies and tell them to turn on service in the
            new place. Schedule a date when they will terminate service in the
            old place.
          </li>

          <li>
            Pack your belongings in boxes. Mark each box with its intended
            location in the new home, and with a summary of its contents. When
            you are close to moving day, pack a separate bag with items you will
            need right away, such as medications, toiletries, and clothing.
          </li>

          <li>
            Switch your direct payroll deposit, and any automatic payments, to
            your new checking account. You will have to fill out a form to
            accomplish this. Two or three days before you move, take the money
            out of your old account and transfer it to your new account.
          </li>
        </ul>

          When looking for a real estate agent, you may come across the
          following commonly used titles. Here is a basic definition of each:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <em>Principal broker:</em> This is a person who is licensed to
              operate a real estate office. He or she may either work alone or
              employ other agents. Several years of experience are required to
              obtain this licensure. Anyone selling real estate must work under
              the supervision of a principal broker.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <em>Realtor:</em> A realtor is a member of the National
              Association of Realtors, along with a state realtors' association
              and a local board of realtors. Realtors are bound by a code of
              ethics. They are able to access a local computerized database of
              homes for sale known as the multiple listing service (MLS).
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <em>Agent:</em> This is the general term for any licensed
              professional in the real estate sales business.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <em>Listing agent:</em> A type of agent who signs up the home
              seller and lists the home with the multiple listing service.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <em>Selling agent:</em> An agent who finds a home for sale
              (through the multiple listing service) and finds a buyer for it.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <em>Buyer's agent:</em> The buyer's agent is employed by the
              broker selected by the buyer.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
