    If you're 62 or older and looking for money to finance a home improvement,
    pay off your current mortgage, supplement your retirement income, or pay for
    healthcare expenses â€“ you may be considering a reverse mortgage. It's a
    product that allows you to convert part of the equity in your home into cash
    without having to sell your home or pay additional monthly bills. This
    Financial Guide explains how reverse mortgages work.

  <p>Three types of reverse mortgage plans are available:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Single-purpose reverse mortgages, offered by some state and local
      government agencies and nonprofit organizations
    </li>

    <li>
      Federally-insured reverse mortgages, known as Home Equity Conversion
      Mortgages (HECMs) and backed by the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban
      Development (HUD)
    </li>

    <li>
      Proprietary reverse mortgages, private loans that are backed by the
      companies that develop them
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p></p>
  <p>
    This guide describes the similarities and differences among them and
    discusses the benefits and drawbacks of each. Since each plan differs
    slightly, it is important to choose the one that best meets your financial
    needs.
  </p>

  <p>
    The reverse mortgage is not without risk however, and knowing the pros and
    cons will help you acquire the best possible deal should you decide to go
    with a reverse mortgage. Staying informed of your rights and
    responsibilities as a borrower may help to minimize your financial risks and
    avoid the threat of losing your home.
  </p>

  <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="1"></a>How Does A Reverse Mortgage Work?</h3>

  <p>
    A reverse mortgage is a type of home equity loan that allows you to convert
    some of the equity in your home into cash while you continue to own the
    home. Reverse mortgages operate like traditional mortgages, only in reverse.
    Rather than paying your lender each month, the lender pays you.
  </p>

  <p>
    Reverse mortgages differ from home equity loans in that most reverse
    mortgages do not require any repayment of principal, interest, or servicing
    fees as long as you live in the home. The loan is repaid when you die, sell
    your home, or when your home is no longer your primary residence. The
    proceeds of a reverse mortgage generally are tax-free, and many reverse
    mortgages have no income restrictions. When the homeowner dies or moves out,
    the loan is paid off by a sale of the property. Any leftover equity belongs
    to the homeowner or the heirs.
  </p>

  <p>
    In other words, the primary benefit of a reverse mortgage is that it allows
    homeowners who are age 62 and over to keep living in their homes and to use
    their equity for whatever purpose they choose. A reverse mortgage might be
    used to cover the cost of home health care, to pay off an existing mortgage
    to stop a foreclosure, or to support children or grandchildren.

  <h3 class="cellcolor">
    <a name="2"></a>Who Qualifies for a Reverse Mortgage?
  </h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Applicants must be 62 years of age.</li>

    <li>
      Potential borrowers must either completely own their home or only have a
      couple of mortgage payments remaining.
    </li>

    <li>
      Reverse mortgage borrowers must live in the home being used as collateral.
    </li>

    <li>
      Borrowers must have an excellent credit history in order to qualify for
      reverse mortgage loans.
    </li>

    <li>
      All homeowners are required to sign the paperwork in order to secure the
      reverse mortgage.
    </li>

    <li>
      Primarily, single family one-unit dwellings are required to qualify for a
      reverse mortgage.
    </li>

    <li>
      During the reverse mortgage process, the homeowners are responsible for
      property taxes and repairs to the property as they still own their home.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p> -->

  <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="3"></a>How Payments Are Received</h3>

  <p>
    Depending on the lender, borrowers can choose to receive monthly payments, a
    lump sum, a line of credit, or some combination.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      The line of credit offers the most flexibility by allowing homeowners to
      write checks on their equity when needed up to the limit of the loan
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <!-- <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p> -->

  <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="4"></a>Tax Rules</h3>

  <p>
    The reverse mortgage payments you receive are nontaxable. Further, if you
    receive Social Security Supplemental Security Income, reverse mortgage
    payments do not affect your benefits, as long as you spend them within the
    month you receive them. This rule is also true for Medicaid benefits in most
    states.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      To find out the exact impact of reverse mortgage payments on benefits you
      are receiving, check with a benefits specialist at your local area agency
      on aging or legal services office.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Interest on reverse mortgages is not deductible until you pay off your
    reverse mortgage debt.
  </p>

  <!-- <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p> -->

  <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="5"></a>Maximum Loan Amounts</h3>

  <p>
    Maximum loan amount limits are based on the value of the home, the
    borrower's age and life expectancy, the loan's interest rate, and whatever
    the lender's policies are. Maximum loan amounts range (depending on the
    lender) from 50% to 75% of the home's fair market value. The general rule
    is: The older the homeowner and the more valuable the home, the more money
    will be available.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="example">
    <p>
      <strong>Example:</strong> A 65-year-old homeowner with a home worth
      $150,000 would be able to get a $30,000 lump sum or credit line. A
      90-year-old homeowner with the same home could be eligible for as much as
      $94,000.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    All reverse mortgages have non-recourse clauses, meaning the debt cannot be
    more than the home's value. Thus, the lender seeks repayment from heirs,
    family members, or the borrower's income or other assets.
  </p>

  <!-- <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p> -->

  <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="6"></a>Negative Aspects</h3>

  <p>Here are some of the downside aspects of reverse mortgages.</p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>You Incur a Large Amount of Interest Debt</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    Reverse mortgages are rising-debt loans: The interest is added to the loan
    balance each month, since it is not paid currently, and the total interest
    you owe increases greatly over time as the interest compounds.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="note">
    <p>
      Some plans provide for fixed rate interest. Others have adjustable rates
      that change based on market conditions.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Fewer Assets for Heirs</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    Reverse mortgages use up the equity in your home, leaving fewer assets for
    your heirs.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>High Costs</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    The high up-front costs of reverse mortgage may make them less attractive to
    some people. All three types of plans charge origination fee, interest rate,
    closing costs, and servicing fees. Insured plans also charge insurance
    premiums.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      If you are forced to move soon after taking the reverse mortgage (e.g.,
      because of illness), you will almost certainly end up with a great deal
      less equity to live on than if you had simply sold the house. This is
      particularly true in the case of loans terminated in five years or less.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      Your lender may permit you to finance these costs, so that you won't have
      to pay them up front. But they will be added to your loan amount. Because
      of the high up-front costs on all reverse mortgages, effective interest
      rates for short-term loans are out of this world.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Adjustable Interest Rates</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    With many reverse mortgage plans, interest rates are adjustable annually or
    monthly and tied to a financial index, in some cases with limits on how far
    the rate can go up or down. Reverse mortgages with interest rates that
    adjust monthly have no limit. Bear in mind that the higher the rate, the
    faster your equity is used up.
  </p>

  <p>
    In order to give a fixed rate, one lender requires appreciation sharing,
    with which it gets a part of any increase in the home's value over and above
    the debt. Another lender offers percent of value pricing, collecting a fixed
    percentage of the home's value when the loan comes due. The latter option
    can be very expensive if the loan must be paid off after only a few years.
  </p>

  <!-- <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p> -->

  <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="7"></a>Is A Reverse Mortgage For You?</h3>

  <p>
    Although a reverse mortgage may be the answer for house-rich and cash-poor
    retirees, they are not for everyone. For instance, if you plan to move a few
    years down the road or there is a possibility you will have to move due to
    illness or any other unforeseen event, then a reverse mortgage makes no
    sense. They make the most sense for those who plan to stay in their homes
    permanently. Also, if you already have a substantial mortgage on your home,
    the reverse mortgage is probably not for you, since you will have to pay it
    off before you can become eligible.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want to pass your home to your children or heirs, the reverse
    mortgage is also not a good choice since the lender will get most of the
    equity when the home is sold.
  </p>

  <!-- <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p> -->

  <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="8"></a>Other Alternatives</h3>

  <p>Besides the reverse mortgage, here are some alternatives to consider.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Programs that help with real estate taxes, repairs.</em> Many state
        and local governments have programs that provide special purpose loans
        to seniors for (1) the deferral of property taxes and (2) making home
        repairs or improvements. These loans can often prevent retirees' having
        to sell their homes. To find out whether your state has a
        special-purpose loan program for property taxes and/or for home repairs
        and improvements, contact your state agency on aging.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        <em>The Qualified Personal Residence Trust (QPRT).</em> If you want to
        pass your home to your children or other heirs, this option should be
        considered, especially if your home is worth a great deal and you want
        to remove it from your estate for estate tax purposes. The QPRT trust
        allows you to keep the home for a certain amount of time with ownership
        eventually passing to your heirs.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        <em>The sale-leaseback.</em> You sell your home to your kids, and
        continue to live in it, paying them a fair market rent.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote class="note">
    <p>Do not arrange a sale-leaseback without professional guidance.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <!-- <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p> -->

  <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="9"></a>Getting a Good Deal</h3>

  <p>
    Reverse mortgages are complex financial transactions. How do you know you
    are getting the best deal? Fortunately there are laws in place (such as the
    Federal Truth in Lending Act) to make sure you understand the terms and
    costs involved before you sign. The Federal Truth in Lending Act requires
    lenders to disclose such things as the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) and
    payment terms. On plans with adjustable rates, lenders must provide specific
    information about the variable rate feature. On plans with credit lines,
    lenders also must inform you of any charges to open and use the account,
    such as an appraisal, a credit report, or attorney's fees.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're considering a reverse mortgage, shop around. Compare your options
    and the terms various lenders offer. Learn as much as you can about reverse
    mortgages before you talk to a counselor or lender. That can help inform the
    questions you ask that could lead to a better deal.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want to make a home repair or improvement or you need help paying
    your property taxes, then you should find out if you qualify for any
    low-cost single-purpose loans in your area. Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs)
    generally know about these programs. To find the nearest agency, visit
    www.eldercare.gov or call 1-800-677-1116. Ask about "loan or grant programs
    for home repairs or improvements," or "property tax deferral" or "property
    tax postponement" programs, and how to apply.
  </p>

  <p>
    All HECM lenders must follow HUD rules. And while the mortgage insurance
    premium is the same from lender to lender, most loan costs, including the
    origination fee, interest rate, closing costs, and servicing fees vary among
    lenders.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you live in a higher-valued home, you may be able to borrow more with a
    proprietary reverse mortgage, but the more you borrow, the higher your costs
    are. The best way to see key differences between a HECM and a proprietary
    loan is to do a side-by-side comparison of costs and benefits. Many HECM
    counselors and lenders can give you this important information.
  </p>

  <p>
    No matter what type of reverse mortgage you're considering, understand all
    the conditions that could make the loan due and payable. Ask a counselor or
    lender to explain the Total Annual Loan Cost (TALC) rates: they show the
    projected annual average cost of a reverse mortgage, including all the
    itemized costs.
  </p>

  <!-- <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p> -->

  <h3 class="cellcolor"><a name="10"></a>A Summary of Available Plans</h3>

  <p>
    This section describes the three types of reverse mortgages available.
    Although the FHA and lender-insured plans appear similar, important
    differences exist. This section also discusses advantages and drawbacks of
    each loan type.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>FHA-Insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs)</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    Backed by the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), over
    90 percent of all reverse mortgages are HECMs. These mortgages offer several
    payment options:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Monthly loan advances for a fixed term, or for as long as you live in the
      home
    </li>
    <li>A line of credit</li>
    <li>Monthly loan advances plus a line of credit</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This type of reverse mortgage is not due as long as you live in your home.
    With the line of credit option, you may draw amounts as you need them over
    time. Closing costs, a mortgage insurance premium, and, sometimes, a monthly
    servicing fee are required. Interest is at an adjustable rate on your loan
    balance. Interest rate changes do not affect the monthly payment, but rather
    how quickly your loan balance grows.
  </p>

  <p>
    The FHA-insured reverse mortgage allows you to change the way you are paid
    at little cost. This plan also protects you by guaranteeing that loan
    advances will continue to be made to you if a lender defaults. However, the
    downside of FHA-insured reverse mortgages is that they may provide smaller
    loan advances than lender-insured plans. Also, loan costs may be greater
    than with uninsured plans.
  </p>

  <p>
    The most widely available plan is the Federal Housing Administration's
    Government-insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program. To
    qualify for an HECM loan, homeowners must be at least 62 and live in a
    single-family home or condominium that is their principal residence. Under
    this program, the amount of equity homeowners may borrow against depends on
    where they live, as well as on prevailing interest rates.
  </p>

  <p>
    For people who have more expensive homes or who need to borrow more, there
    are alternatives. A program from the Federal National Mortgage Association
    grants larger reverse mortgages on home equity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Counseling is required before homeowners can apply for an HECM loan. This
    counseling allows homeowners to discover whether a reverse mortgage is
    really the best answer to their cash-flow problems.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>For an approved counselor, contact any HECM lender.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Single-purpose reverse mortgages</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    Offered by some state and local government agencies and nonprofit
    organizations, these reverse mortgages are the least expensive option. They
    are not available everywhere and can be used for only one purpose, which is
    specified by the government or nonprofit lender. For example, the lender
    might say the loan may be used only to pay for home repairs, improvements,
    or property taxes. Most homeowners with low or moderate income can qualify
    for these loans.
  </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>Proprietary reverse mortgages</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    This type of reverse mortgage is a private loan that is backed by the
    company that develops it. Like HECM loans, they may be more expensive than
    traditional home loans and upfront costs can be high. There are no income
    requirements and can be used for any purpose.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      Most private reverse mortgages are not insured. Only the strength of the
      lender backs whatever promises it may make as to payments and other terms.
      So if you are looking to a reverse mortgage for future income, rather than
      a lump sum up front, you are better off in a federally insured program.
